He quotes physician Dr. James Hamblin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The thing is if shutdowns and social distancing work perfectly and are extremely effective it will seem in retrospect like they were totally unnecessary overreactions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and epidemiologist Mari Armstrong-Hough:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You won’t ever know if what you did personally helped. That’s the nature of public health. When the best way to save lives is to prevent a disease rather than treat it, success often looks like an overreaction.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From an email newsletter from <a href=\"https://chriskresser.com/\">Chris Kresser</a></p>\n",
				"content_text": "Along the same lines, [Jason Kottke wrote an excellent article](https://kottke.org/20/03/the-paradox-of-preparation?utm_campaign=Chris%20Kresser&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=85044513&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9LtIaL6ZiQ1FvUhu_0QHjCsl9k_hs6wQYiGI4BLHGH8PFYGgU2oGfKc95W8kZO3bhkOmi5GHtvCdb-sOLganPDOXHMog&_hsmi=85044513) explaining why, in a pandemic like COVID-19, appropriate actions to “flatten the curve” often seem like overkill both at the time they are taken, and in retrospect. He quotes physician Dr. James Hamblin:\n\n> “The thing is if shutdowns and social distancing work perfectly and are extremely effective it will seem in retrospect like they were totally unnecessary overreactions.”\n\nand epidemiologist Mari Armstrong-Hough:\n\n>“You won’t ever know if what you did personally helped. That’s the nature of public health. When the best way to save lives is to prevent a disease rather than treat it, success often looks like an overreaction.”\n\nFrom an email newsletter from [Chris Kresser](https://chriskresser.com/)\n",

This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context.

It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.</p>\n\n<p>Retweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more.</p>\n\n<p>A second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one&rsquo;s own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don&rsquo;t see much from those same people.</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, there is that curation thing. I don&rsquo;t love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that.

And,yes, I know: there are a thousand so-called Bullet Journal (BuJo) bloggers and vloggers with lots of decorative and/or practical layouts I could draw trace or tape into my journal.\n\nBut, if, instead, I can simply print from an application I have open all-day, every-day, then I feel like that is a win.\n\nIt would be more perfect if I could print on A4, but I will take what I can get.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have a large iTunes library. It doesn&rsquo;t represent everything I have ever heard, nor everything I have ever loved, nor even everything I own. But that iTunes library is becoming a beast to manage.<br /><br />There is SO much data about the music—that isn&rsquo;t the music—but is integral.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I have made it a personal project to make sure a single piece of information exists for each track: the release date, the day it became available for sale to the public.</p>\n\n<p>I began this project because I was completely dismayed at the amount of music I have imported into my library without a date at all, and also frustrated by the number of albums imported with a re-release date instead of the original release date. The re-release date to me is like restoring a 1966 Ford Mustang and then saying it is a current-year Ford Mustang. No. Therefore, even when an album is remastered a second or third time, it is still a product of its era.</p>\n\n<p>The release date is important to me. I remember where and when a piece of music was first a part of my life. I remember the order albums were released by favorite artists. So, when I sort my library by date, I want it to match that experience. For example, when I was a Freshman in high school, there was a radio show from midnight to 2 AM on Monday mornings where I first heard <em>Mad World</em> by Tears for Fears. This is opposed to the first time I heard <em>Shout</em>, also by Tears for Fears. I was a Junior in high school by then. I walked into Musicland in the Ridgedale mall in Minnetonka, Minnesota. It was playing in store and I bought the cassette on the spot. So my iTunes library had better get it right.</p>\n\n<p>Aside: In the movie High Fidelity, the protagonist spends significant time sorting his collection of albums chronologically by relationship. <em>This makes enormous sense to me</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Back to data: that raw list of data—disembodied though it is from the music—is becoming something I refer to much as I used to refer to liner notes, those tiny cassette j-cards, or the somewhat larger CD booklets. I don&rsquo;t always remember the details, so I want iTunes to be true.</p>\n\n<p>Another case where I find date information jarring is with “greatest hits” or other career-spanning collections of songs. The date associated with a song in this case is often the release date of the collection. Yet, that date might be decades removed from when a song in the collection was originally released. This is important to me because I have playlists built by decade. When I am hearing <em>Can&rsquo;t Get You Out Of My Head</em>, which Kylie Minogue released in 2002 (in the US), I don&rsquo;t necessarily want the next track I hear to be _Mother&rsquo;s Little Helper_ just because the Rolling Stones&rsquo; “Forty Licks” compilation was also released in 2002.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which, it took the “Forty Licks” compilation to make me realize I am a bigger &lsquo;Stones fan than I thought, particularly with material released before 1970. I also now have a more profound respect for their career longevity. They are still making music.</p>\n\n<p>So, in my iTunes library, the songs from “Forty Licks” all reflect the year they were released as singles, with the exception of the four tracks that appear nowhere else—those tracks stay in 2002, though I did for a long time consider dating them from the sessions in which they were recorded. <em>I have reconsidered this position repeatedly</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are still about 3,000 items in my library that are un-dated.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on missing or incorrect album art.</p>\n\n<p>I will be researching music for a long time to come.</p>\n\n<p>This post was brought to you by WikiPedia, Discogs.org, and Google Image Search.</p>\n",

I remember where and when a piece of music was first a part of my life. I remember the order albums were released by favorite artists. So, when I sort my library by date, I want it to match that experience. For example, when I was a Freshman in high school, there was a radio show from midnight to 2 AM on Monday mornings where I first heard _Mad World_ by Tears for Fears. This is opposed to the first time I heard _Shout_, also by Tears for Fears. I was a Junior in high school by then. I walked into Musicland in the Ridgedale mall in Minnetonka, Minnesota. It was playing in store and I bought the cassette on the spot. So my iTunes library had better get it right.\n\nAside: In the movie High Fidelity, the protagonist spends significant time sorting his collection of albums chronologically by relationship. _This makes enormous sense to me_.\n\nBack to data: that raw list of data—disembodied though it is from the music—is becoming something I refer to much as I used to refer to liner notes, those tiny cassette j-cards, or the somewhat larger CD booklets. I don't always remember the details, so I want iTunes to be true.\n\nAnother case where I find date information jarring is with “greatest hits” or other career-spanning collections of songs. The date associated with a song in this case is often the release date of the collection. Yet, that date might be decades removed from when a song in the collection was originally released. This is important to me because I have playlists built by decade. When I am hearing _Can't Get You Out Of My Head_, which Kylie Minogue released in 2002 (in the US), I don't necessarily want the next track I hear to be _Mother's Little Helper_ just because the Rolling Stones' “Forty Licks” compilation was also released in 2002.\n\nSpeaking of which, it took the “Forty Licks” compilation to make me realize I am a bigger 'Stones fan than I thought, particularly with material released before 1970. I also now have a more profound respect for their career longevity. They are still making music.\n\nSo, in my iTunes library, the songs from “Forty Licks” all reflect the year they were released as singles, with the exception of the four tracks that appear nowhere else—those tracks stay in 2002, though I did for a long time consider dating them from the sessions in which they were recorded. _I have reconsidered this position repeatedly_.\n\nThere are still about 3,000 items in my library that are un-dated.\n\nDon't even get me started on missing or incorrect album art.\n\nI will be researching music for a long time to come.\n\nThis post was brought to you by WikiPedia, Discogs.org, and Google Image Search.\n",
