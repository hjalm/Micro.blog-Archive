				"content_html": "<p>Setting up iCloud on one Windows laptop actually went smoothly. Every tool did exactly what it was supposed to do. This, even though I have combined my vanity email domain with iCloud.</p>\n<p>To be fair, I actually <em>send</em> email from my personal account only slightly more often than I phone people from my personal number, which is close to (but not quite) never.</p>\n<p>On a desktop, this did not happen. Even with Office365 installed, the iCloud tool only synced calendars and contacts. The Apple installer told me if I need iCloud email, to set up an address online.</p>\n<p>I also could not use my primary email address, which matches my AppleID, to set up my mailbox in Outlook. I had to use the original icloud.com email address, and set up an application password through my AppleID, in order to set up the service.</p>\n<p>Possibly related, in the past I have used Google to host my vanity domain. Whenever the Outlook email setup wizard walked me through account setup, it wanted me to authenticate to Google. I don&rsquo;t know if that is residual in Microsoft365, or if there is something in DNS that is making Microsoft go there. I really thought I had cleaned house at my provider.</p>\n<p>In the end, I can monitor my mailbox from a second Windows PC. That is what I needed. But the process took the better part of 2 hours of experimentation, including waiting several times on a &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting things ready&rdquo; message from Outlook while nothing happenned in the GUI.</p>\n<p>None of the Apple machines ever have trouble, and I was aware that doing iCloud on Windows could present challenges. But when things actually behaved well on one Windows 11 machine, I had hope it might go equally well on another.</p>\n<p>All of this to avoid the security hoops signing into iCloud through a web browser, or simply checking email on my phone.

				"content_text": "Setting up iCloud on one Windows laptop actually went smoothly. Every tool did exactly what it was supposed to do. This, even though I have combined my vanity email domain with iCloud.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, I actually _send_ email from my personal account only slightly more often than I phone people from my personal number, which is close to (but not quite) never. \r\n\r\nOn a desktop, this did not happen. Even with Office365 installed, the iCloud tool only synced calendars and contacts. The Apple installer told me if I need iCloud email, to set up an address online.\r\n\r\nI also could not use my primary email address, which matches my AppleID, to set up my mailbox in Outlook. I had to use the original icloud.com email address, and set up an application password through my AppleID, in order to set up the service.\r\n\r\nPossibly related, in the past I have used Google to host my vanity domain. Whenever the Outlook email setup wizard walked me through account setup, it wanted me to authenticate to Google. I don't know if that is residual in Microsoft365, or if there is something in DNS that is making Microsoft go there. I really thought I had cleaned house at my provider.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I can monitor my mailbox from a second Windows PC. That is what I needed. But the process took the better part of 2 hours of experimentation, including waiting several times on a \"We're getting things ready\" message from Outlook while nothing happenned in the GUI.\r\n\r\nNone of the Apple machines ever have trouble, and I was aware that doing iCloud on Windows could present challenges. But when things actually behaved well on one Windows 11 machine, I had hope it might go equally well on another.\r\n\r\nAll of this to avoid the security hoops signing into iCloud through a web browser, or simply checking email on my phone. I want to avoid transcribing password reset links or login links. Even NVidia nags for a login for video drivers, holding some software functions hostage to it.\r\n\r\nAs in all things technological, some days it's deeply challenging to make software do the thing it is meant to do. I blame both companies for making me use wizards, and not giving me the option to set things manually. Even with the mailbox established, I cannot dig into Outlook to see what settings the software is using to connect (server names, ports, security protocols)\r\n\r\nSo, if you can't set up your iCloud mailbox in Outlook via the iCloud application, use the original icloud.com email address (me.com didn't work for me) to set up an IMAP account. Use an application password that you will generate at appleid.apple.com for the password. Nothing I found online says it exactly that way, especially for those of us who have the vanity email domain.\r\n\r\nLastly? You will be sending as your iCloud address, or via your default account in Outlook. I can theoretically use a reply-to address, but I think that looks sketchy.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Putting some thoughts here, while they are on my mind:</p>\n<p>Political parties and news organizations love to pretend that an election is an ideological mandate. When the candidate you vote for wins, it&rsquo;s fun to feel that way.</p>\n<p>I think an election is simpler, it&rsquo;s a snapshot in time, and it&rsquo;s very much about who is on the ballot.

I had only used a test machine for 90 minutes at work by that point.</p>\n<p>Another client wanting to stay on top of security updates demonstrated the thing I feared. Printing to a Canon workgroup printer from Big Sur did not work well. Canon&rsquo;s American web site did not have macOS 15 drivers, which was not shocking.

Stat. § 12.29, I issued an Emergency Declaration, declaring a Peacetime Emergency due to the civil unrest occurring throughout Saint Paul.</p>\n<p>Saint Paul Leg. Code Chapter 13.06(b) provides that, “whenever necessary to meet an emergency … the mayor may by executive order promulgate regulations … for which adequate regulations have not been adopted … respecting …the conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair, maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health, fire and safety regulations; and all other matters which are required to protect public safety, health and welfare in emergencies”.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed and in the custody of officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Other Minneapolis police officers stood guard as witnesses begged the officers to provide life-saving aid to George Floyd. Civil unrest has arisen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since Mr. Floyd’s death. This civil unrest included mass protests in Minneapolis on May 26-28, 2020 which caused injuries, looting and the destruction of public and private property. This civil unrest, including looting and the destruction of property, has spread to Saint Paul as of May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020 the Saint Paul Fire Chief reported that between May 28, 2020 and May 29, 2020, the City received over 300 calls for service for fires, 126 of which were related to fire calls and 55 of which were confirmed. A curfew is necessary in order to ensure the public safety of the people of Saint Paul.</p>\n<p>Governor Walz, in Executive Order 20-56, has declared a peacetime emergency in the City of Saint Paul as well as the City of Minneapolis and the “surrounding communities”. Governor Walz, as part of Executive Order 20-56, has also activated the National Guard to support in emergency operations and response. On May 29, 2020. Governor Walz issued Executive Order 20-65 implementing a night-time curfew in the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, do hereby issue the following Emergency Executive Order:</p>\n<p>Night-time Curfew: effective May, 29, 2020, at 8:00 P.M. a curfew is imposed in all public places within the City of Saint Paul between the hours of 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nTravel Prohibited. During the curfew, all persons must not travel on any public street or public place.\nExemptions. All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, and members of the news media, as well as other personnel authorized by the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol, or Minnesota National Guard, are exempt from the curfew.

				"content_text": "Executive Order May 29, 2020, 2020-11\n\n[EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-11](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/emergency-management/coronavirus-covid-19/emergency-executive-orders#May%2029,%202020-11)\n\nI, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, on May 29, 2020, pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code Section 13.06, do hereby issue the following Executive Order:\n\nOn May 29, 2020, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 12.29, I issued an Emergency Declaration, declaring a Peacetime Emergency due to the civil unrest occurring throughout Saint Paul.\n\nSaint Paul Leg. Code Chapter 13.06(b) provides that, “whenever necessary to meet an emergency … the mayor may by executive order promulgate regulations … for which adequate regulations have not been adopted … respecting …the conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair, maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health, fire and safety regulations; and all other matters which are required to protect public safety, health and welfare in emergencies”.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed and in the custody of officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Other Minneapolis police officers stood guard as witnesses begged the officers to provide life-saving aid to George Floyd. Civil unrest has arisen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since Mr. Floyd’s death. This civil unrest included mass protests in Minneapolis on May 26-28, 2020 which caused injuries, looting and the destruction of public and private property. This civil unrest, including looting and the destruction of property, has spread to Saint Paul as of May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020 the Saint Paul Fire Chief reported that between May 28, 2020 and May 29, 2020, the City received over 300 calls for service for fires, 126 of which were related to fire calls and 55 of which were confirmed. A curfew is necessary in order to ensure the public safety of the people of Saint Paul.\n\nGovernor Walz, in Executive Order 20-56, has declared a peacetime emergency in the City of Saint Paul as well as the City of Minneapolis and the “surrounding communities”. Governor Walz, as part of Executive Order 20-56, has also activated the National Guard to support in emergency operations and response. On May 29, 2020. Governor Walz issued Executive Order 20-65 implementing a night-time curfew in the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, do hereby issue the following Emergency Executive Order:\n\nNight-time Curfew: effective May, 29, 2020, at 8:00 P.M. a curfew is imposed in all public places within the City of Saint Paul between the hours of 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nTravel Prohibited. During the curfew, all persons must not travel on any public street or public place.\nExemptions. All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, and members of the news media, as well as other personnel authorized by the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol, or Minnesota National Guard, are exempt from the curfew. Individuals traveling directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing danger, or experiencing homelessness are also exempt.\n\nDefinitions.\na. For the purposes of this Executive Order, “travel” includes, without limitation, travel on foot, bicycle, skateboard, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, or any other mode of transporting a person from one location to another.\nb. For the purposes of this Executive Order, a “public place” is any place, whether on privately or publicly owned property, accessible to the general public, including but not limited to public streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks, vacant lots, and unsupervised property.\nEnforcement.\na. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 12.45, an individual who willfully violates this Executive Order is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days.\nb. Any person who disobeys a lawful order of a regular member or auxiliary member of the police or fire departments enforcing this Executive Order or another person having a specific emergency management assignment and displaying their official identification enforcing this Executive Order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code 13.13.\n\nPursuant to Chapter 13 of the Saint Paul Legislative Code, this Executive Order is in immediate effect upon my signature and, if not sooner rescinded or later extended, shall expire at 6:00 A.M. on May 31, 2020.\n",

				"title": "How I Made Twitter Enjoyable Again",
				"content_html": "<p>I have transitioned to <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> as my primary online presence, but I still have my Twitter account. While I have often entertained leaving it altogether, I still wish to keep my handle. I have also found that with thoughtful curation, it&rsquo;s still a place to learn new things about the world and to be excited by new people and topics.</p>\n<p>One big change came after applying a suggestion from <a href=\"https://micro.blog/patrickrhone\">@patrickrhone</a>. He announced that he had turned off retweets for accounts he follows. This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context. It takes more time to share tweets this way, so the tweets shared in this fashion are more meaningful. It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.</p>\n<p>Retweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more.</p>\n<p>A second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one&rsquo;s own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don&rsquo;t see much from those same people.</p>\n<p>And lastly, there is that curation thing. I don&rsquo;t love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that. When accounts make me angry or sad, I simply unfollow. When I can no longer tell why I followed a specific account, I unfollow. When I see accounts that appear to be trolling or are otherwise propagating falsehoods because they can, I block.

				"content_text": "I have transitioned to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) as my primary online presence, but I still have my Twitter account. While I have often entertained leaving it altogether, I still wish to keep my handle. I have also found that with thoughtful curation, it's still a place to learn new things about the world and to be excited by new people and topics.\n\nOne big change came after applying a suggestion from [@patrickrhone](https://micro.blog/patrickrhone). He announced that he had turned off retweets for accounts he follows. This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context. It takes more time to share tweets this way, so the tweets shared in this fashion are more meaningful. It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.\n\nRetweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more. \n\nA second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one's own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don't see much from those same people.\n\nAnd lastly, there is that curation thing. I don't love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that. When accounts make me angry or sad, I simply unfollow. When I can no longer tell why I followed a specific account, I unfollow. When I see accounts that appear to be trolling or are otherwise propagating falsehoods because they can, I block. Easy.\n\nCurating also can be applied from areas of interest or study or self-improvement. Writers whose work appears in places that excite me are easy follows. Artists whose work I admire are easy follows. Companies doing work I'm interested in are easy follows. Individuals committed to causes dear to me are easy follows. But all of the filters above apply.\n\nEven though I have put strict filters in place, the mouth of the funnel is still pretty wide and lots of great material makes it through. I still cannot keep up with the firehose.\n\n\n\n",

While it doesn’t sync to the lyric, I think it tells a similar story that is equally open to interpretation.\n\n<a href=\"http://ilovem83.com/music/albums/saturday-youth/\" target=\"_blank\">Album information at M83's official site</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/M83/_/Kim+%26+Jessie\" target=\"_blank\">Video at Last.fm</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abqy3DdAzHI\" target=\"_blank\">Video at YouTube</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Lyric+m83+kim+and+jessie&oq=Lyric+m83+kim+and+jessie\" target=\"_blank\">Lyrics Sites</a>\n",
