This would have been in the late 1970s or the very early 1980s. I was super dismayed to have my bubble burst in that they weren't currently really a band or making more TV, even in those days.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite songs on their Greatest Hits record was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasant_Valley_Sunday\">Pleasant Valley Sunday</a>, which was probably one of their more famous tracks, but I had no idea about their actual fame, their pre-fab reputation, or the popular influences they might have been incorporating or responding to.</p>\n<p>So I knew nothing specifically about wall-of-sound techniques, or how much it had been done, and by whom, prior to that point in my life.</p>\n<p>I was a kid. Some afternoons I would sit by myself next to my parent's Montgomery Ward console stereo, plug in a pair of dad's Realistic headphones and play records.</p>\n<p>So. Peasant Valley Sunday has a very recognizable guitar riff and a clever lyric and that thing that happens at the end with reverb and repetition where you follow all of the elements of the song into a sort of cacaphony that ends in an orchestral drone. I used to pick an element, the guitar riff, or a vocal element, and see how long I could follow it until I lost track of it in the mix.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't learn about Phil Spector and the Wall of Sound techniques or recording techniques and effects at all for another decade.</p>\n<p>However, I note with increasing frequency, the music I really love today, shoegaze and nu-gaze and the things that sound that way, I have been thinking of that one track produced by a group of guys on an album where they really did play their instruments and wanted a little bit of credit for being more than goofy actors.</p>\n<p>The fun starts with the drum roll at about 2:32.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/hjalm\">View Hjalmer Duenow's Crucial Tracks profile</a></p>\n",

Pick your favorite song of theirs..</em></p>\n<p>I had known of them for a year or more before I ever heard them.. The record store in the student union at Mankato State had an import selection kept in a locked case. Cocteau Twins CDs always seemed to be featured. I liked their name, wondered if there was anything to do with Jean Cocteau, and found their cover art mysterious, but they cost enough more than domestic releases that I didn't feel like I could afford to gamble and lose.</p>\n<p>Then, one day watching MTV in my third year, circa 1988 or 1989, I saw and heard \"Carolyn's Fingers\" -- and I recognized the band name from the import discs. And then I knew.</p>\n<p>In the intervening years I think I have every album represented in my collection, though I may not have every EP.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, I was already listening to Depeche Mode and Frankie, and The Cure and New Order, so perhaps it was inevitable. But if you ask me, Finding Cocteau Twins kicked open some other sub-genres for me which fundamentally affect what I choose to listen to, today.</p>\n<p>No one other band I'm aware of sounds like them, but I've been surprised by how many artists mention them.</p>\n<p>I won't try to describe or define their sound. I have always found language completely inadequate and I find myself wanting to make musical noises instead. It's easy enough instead to find them on YouTube or Spotify or Apple Music. Or your library if you're into the legacy media thing.</p>\n<p>There is a YouTube documentary called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFB4gl1Iokl\">Before Loveless: How Shoegaze Became Shoegaze</a>, which centers around a different group and sound, but it holds Cocteau Twins in a place of honor and gives you an idea of a place and a time.</p>\n<p>If you hang around me, you may get sick of me recommending Cocteau Twins.

I have been listening to them since I rediscovered bands were still making Shoegaze in the 2000s. They just released <em>Music for 6 Musicians</em> I think on the 27th, and today I noticed Apple Music recommended the new album to me. I bought it 4 tracks in, and basically listened to it twice straight through. The version of the album I bought has a 40+ minute  <em>Director's Cut</em> at the end which is effectively the full album as a single track. Loved it both times. <em>Movement II</em>, which I have linked to for the purposes of this post, is exemplary.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/hjalm\">View Hjalmer Duenow's Crucial Tracks profile</a></p>\n",

I wish I had known about <em>Sleeper in Metropolis</em> sooner. This is very much a product of its era, released in 1983, and now I have another artist's entire career to explore.</p>\n<p>At any rate, the parallels musically between <em>Sleeper in Metropolis</em> and <em>Tales of Taboo</em> are inescapable and unmistakable. For that reason, the second track falls a little in my esteem, even if the production is amazing and it would have been an excellent 2AM track in an early 90s underground dance club. I won't link to <em>Tales of Taboo</em> for a dozen reasons. Read about it first. Read about Karen Finley's work.</p>\n<p>But Anne Clark, I didn't know you before now. You have helped me make some musical connections that didn't exist before.

Pick your favorite song off that album.</em></p>\n<p>Well, I honestly do not remember the first album I bought. I had some supervised purchases with my parents over several years, which included some good and bad choices, mostly from the Columbia Record and Tape club.</p>\n<p>But the first time I bought music of my own volition with money I had in my pocket, I could not have been more than about 12 or 13 years old. I was in the local Ben Franklin drugstore and found a 7\" 45 RPM single of Gary Numan's <em>Cars</em> from The Pleasure Principle LP. The flip side was <em>I Die: You Die</em>, which was not released on an album. Atlantic had reissued it as an Oldie, so I bought it because I liked and remembered <em>Cars</em> from Top 40 radio.</p>\n<p>At the time, I didn't have my own turntable or cassette player. My brother and I shared a portable record player in a rec room space, and I think that is how I listened to it when it was new.</p>\n<p>Doing research while writing, I learned that <em>I Die: You Die</em> itself was only released as a single. Then I spent even more time confirming that my memory was correct. I did find the single as I remembered it on <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/release/2981355-Gary-Numan-Cars-I-Die-You-Die\">Discogs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/364968561864\">eBay</a>.</p>\n<p>The actual full album of <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-pleasure-principle-bonus-tracks/251652523\">The Pleasure Principle</a> did not come into my possession until the 1990s, when a colleague at the record store told me that he, too, was a Gary Numan fan. He shared his copy with me, which I immediately dubbed to cassette. Subsequently, it was the first Gary Numan album I purchased digitally.</p>\n<p>I saw Gary live much later at the <a href=\"https://www.numandiscography.co.uk/htdocs/concerts_tours/2006/minneapolisfinelinemusiccafe11082006.php\">Fine Line</a> Music Cafe in Minneapolis. It is still one of my favorite concerts.</p>\n<p>Now, after all of that, my favorite track from The Pleasure Principle is <em>Films</em>. We know Gary Numan for synth-pop, but we forget that he used human musicians. <em>Films</em> has the synth you expect, but the bass line and drums drive the song, and it has been one of my personal favorite tracks for many years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/hjalm\">View Hjalmer Duenow's Crucial Tracks profile</a></p>\n",

I did see \"The Dead\" play at an outdoor concert in a very uptight community that put a significant damper on fan activities. I have also seen Rat Dog play at First Avenue.</p>\n<p>My first <em>exposure</em> to the music of The Grateful Dead was via a group called Dark Star Orchestra. They're a tribute band that picks a known set list from one of the Grateful Dead's shows, and they play it straight through. They probably play less loosely than the real band themselves might have played, if you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Up to a certain point in my life, I had been a tee-totaler. I had only recently begun to drink beer at social events. My spouse at the time was not at all convinced this was a good idea.</p>\n<p>So.</p>\n<p>I was invited by an excellent friend to a place called Harmony Park, in Southern Minnesota. Dark Star Orchestra was headlining a night at the venue, which is also a camp ground. I met my friend's family and some others there for an overnight event.</p>\n<p>I went by myself, armed with a sleeping bag and a very small tent I borrowed from another friend. I probably brought along some Guiness.</p>\n<p>I was encouraged to do it <em>the right way</em>. This was the music of The 'Dead, after all. It was really interesting to watch other campers around the park in the hour before Dark Star Orchestra took the stage. Costumes changed. Treats were distributed. Lights were hung from poles and from the trees.</p>\n<p>I, too, had some tea and a hit from the bat.</p>\n<p>As the evening wore on, perhaps an hour into the show, I was asked about how I was feeling. There was a lot of discussion about what I should notice. As a complete neophyte, I could only shrug and shake my head. I didn't think I felt different. I was given some additional pieces and folks were going to check in on me later.</p>\n<p>It wasn't long after that that I began to notice that it felt really good to look at the stage lights as they moved across the crowd. I also noticed how all of the notes of music fit together into this great cosmic scheme.</p>\n<p>Later, I became terrified I was broken. There was no way I should be feeling this good and that certainly there was no way back from the sky. I began to mourn for my life as it had been.</p>\n<p>After the show I walked around and around the grounds. I watched the fire spinners and listened to the drum circles. I was transfixed by the gently pulsing lights some more experienced campers had hung at their camp sites. I listened to the laughter of campers and the music they had playing. I couldn't believe smoke from a camp fire could smell so good. I didn't know that pine forests could small so amazing. I didn't know there were kaleidoscopes behind my eyelids.</p>\n<p>And I started to understand popular music and how and why it sounds the way it does just a little bit more.</p>\n<p>I love <em>Eyes of the World</em> by The Grateful Dead. I've heard several live versions from  the Dick's Picks collections I've picked up since then. I'm partial to one version that's about 15 minutes long. No one would ever call me a Dead Head, but I have knowledge from an experience that resonates to this day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/hjalm\">View Hjalmer Duenow's Crucial Tracks profile</a></p>\n",

Why did it resonate?</em></p>\n<p>There are way too many songs from this period of my life to pick just one. As a result of this prompt, my brain decided to latch onto Simple Minds’ song <em>Don’t You (Forget About Me)</em>. The song was written for the movie <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/2108-the-breakfast-club\"><em>The Breakfast Club</em></a>, which was released in February of 1985, when I would have been a Junior in high school. I was working part-time and for the first time in my life I was feeling connected with my same age peers and feeling seen in my culture. Still today I don’t mind hearing this song even though it was everywhere and relentless on the radio at the time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/hjalm\">View Hjalmer Duenow's Crucial Tracks profile</a></p>\n",

Remains discovered in various parts of the world have had DNA survive and have been subsequently sequenced.

Stat. § 12.29, I issued an Emergency Declaration, declaring a Peacetime Emergency due to the civil unrest occurring throughout Saint Paul.</p>\n<p>Saint Paul Leg. Code Chapter 13.06(b) provides that, “whenever necessary to meet an emergency … the mayor may by executive order promulgate regulations … for which adequate regulations have not been adopted … respecting …the conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair, maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health, fire and safety regulations; and all other matters which are required to protect public safety, health and welfare in emergencies”.</p>\n<p>On May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed and in the custody of officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Other Minneapolis police officers stood guard as witnesses begged the officers to provide life-saving aid to George Floyd. Civil unrest has arisen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since Mr. Floyd’s death. This civil unrest included mass protests in Minneapolis on May 26-28, 2020 which caused injuries, looting and the destruction of public and private property. This civil unrest, including looting and the destruction of property, has spread to Saint Paul as of May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020 the Saint Paul Fire Chief reported that between May 28, 2020 and May 29, 2020, the City received over 300 calls for service for fires, 126 of which were related to fire calls and 55 of which were confirmed. A curfew is necessary in order to ensure the public safety of the people of Saint Paul.</p>\n<p>Governor Walz, in Executive Order 20-56, has declared a peacetime emergency in the City of Saint Paul as well as the City of Minneapolis and the “surrounding communities”. Governor Walz, as part of Executive Order 20-56, has also activated the National Guard to support in emergency operations and response. On May 29, 2020. Governor Walz issued Executive Order 20-65 implementing a night-time curfew in the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, do hereby issue the following Emergency Executive Order:</p>\n<p>Night-time Curfew: effective May, 29, 2020, at 8:00 P.M. a curfew is imposed in all public places within the City of Saint Paul between the hours of 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nTravel Prohibited. During the curfew, all persons must not travel on any public street or public place.\nExemptions. All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, and members of the news media, as well as other personnel authorized by the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol, or Minnesota National Guard, are exempt from the curfew. Individuals traveling directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing danger, or experiencing homelessness are also exempt.</p>\n<p>Definitions.\na. For the purposes of this Executive Order, “travel” includes, without limitation, travel on foot, bicycle, skateboard, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, or any other mode of transporting a person from one location to another.\nb. For the purposes of this Executive Order, a “public place” is any place, whether on privately or publicly owned property, accessible to the general public, including but not limited to public streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks, vacant lots, and unsupervised property.\nEnforcement.\na.

				"content_text": "Executive Order May 29, 2020, 2020-11\n\n[EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-11](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/emergency-management/coronavirus-covid-19/emergency-executive-orders#May%2029,%202020-11)\n\nI, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, on May 29, 2020, pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code Section 13.06, do hereby issue the following Executive Order:\n\nOn May 29, 2020, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 12.29, I issued an Emergency Declaration, declaring a Peacetime Emergency due to the civil unrest occurring throughout Saint Paul.\n\nSaint Paul Leg. Code Chapter 13.06(b) provides that, “whenever necessary to meet an emergency … the mayor may by executive order promulgate regulations … for which adequate regulations have not been adopted … respecting …the conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair, maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health, fire and safety regulations; and all other matters which are required to protect public safety, health and welfare in emergencies”.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed and in the custody of officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Other Minneapolis police officers stood guard as witnesses begged the officers to provide life-saving aid to George Floyd. Civil unrest has arisen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since Mr. Floyd’s death. This civil unrest included mass protests in Minneapolis on May 26-28, 2020 which caused injuries, looting and the destruction of public and private property. This civil unrest, including looting and the destruction of property, has spread to Saint Paul as of May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020 the Saint Paul Fire Chief reported that between May 28, 2020 and May 29, 2020, the City received over 300 calls for service for fires, 126 of which were related to fire calls and 55 of which were confirmed. A curfew is necessary in order to ensure the public safety of the people of Saint Paul.\n\nGovernor Walz, in Executive Order 20-56, has declared a peacetime emergency in the City of Saint Paul as well as the City of Minneapolis and the “surrounding communities”. Governor Walz, as part of Executive Order 20-56, has also activated the National Guard to support in emergency operations and response. On May 29, 2020. Governor Walz issued Executive Order 20-65 implementing a night-time curfew in the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, do hereby issue the following Emergency Executive Order:\n\nNight-time Curfew: effective May, 29, 2020, at 8:00 P.M. a curfew is imposed in all public places within the City of Saint Paul between the hours of 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.\nTravel Prohibited. During the curfew, all persons must not travel on any public street or public place.\nExemptions. All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, and members of the news media, as well as other personnel authorized by the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol, or Minnesota National Guard, are exempt from the curfew. Individuals traveling directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing danger, or experiencing homelessness are also exempt.\n\nDefinitions.\na. For the purposes of this Executive Order, “travel” includes, without limitation, travel on foot, bicycle, skateboard, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, or any other mode of transporting a person from one location to another.\nb. For the purposes of this Executive Order, a “public place” is any place, whether on privately or publicly owned property, accessible to the general public, including but not limited to public streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks, vacant lots, and unsupervised property.\nEnforcement.\na. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 12.45, an individual who willfully violates this Executive Order is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days.\nb. Any person who disobeys a lawful order of a regular member or auxiliary member of the police or fire departments enforcing this Executive Order or another person having a specific emergency management assignment and displaying their official identification enforcing this Executive Order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code 13.13.\n\nPursuant to Chapter 13 of the Saint Paul Legislative Code, this Executive Order is in immediate effect upon my signature and, if not sooner rescinded or later extended, shall expire at 6:00 A.M. on May 31, 2020.\n",

				"title": "How I Made Twitter Enjoyable Again",
				"content_html": "<p>I have transitioned to <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> as my primary online presence, but I still have my Twitter account. While I have often entertained leaving it altogether, I still wish to keep my handle. I have also found that with thoughtful curation, it&rsquo;s still a place to learn new things about the world and to be excited by new people and topics.</p>\n<p>One big change came after applying a suggestion from <a href=\"https://micro.blog/patrickrhone\">@patrickrhone</a>. He announced that he had turned off retweets for accounts he follows. This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context. It takes more time to share tweets this way, so the tweets shared in this fashion are more meaningful. It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.</p>\n<p>Retweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more.</p>\n<p>A second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one&rsquo;s own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don&rsquo;t see much from those same people.</p>\n<p>And lastly, there is that curation thing. I don&rsquo;t love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that.

				"content_text": "I have transitioned to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) as my primary online presence, but I still have my Twitter account. While I have often entertained leaving it altogether, I still wish to keep my handle. I have also found that with thoughtful curation, it's still a place to learn new things about the world and to be excited by new people and topics.\n\nOne big change came after applying a suggestion from [@patrickrhone](https://micro.blog/patrickrhone). He announced that he had turned off retweets for accounts he follows. This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context. It takes more time to share tweets this way, so the tweets shared in this fashion are more meaningful. It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.\n\nRetweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more. \n\nA second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one's own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don't see much from those same people.\n\nAnd lastly, there is that curation thing. I don't love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that. When accounts make me angry or sad, I simply unfollow. When I can no longer tell why I followed a specific account, I unfollow. When I see accounts that appear to be trolling or are otherwise propagating falsehoods because they can, I block. Easy.\n\nCurating also can be applied from areas of interest or study or self-improvement. Writers whose work appears in places that excite me are easy follows. Artists whose work I admire are easy follows. Companies doing work I'm interested in are easy follows. Individuals committed to causes dear to me are easy follows. But all of the filters above apply.\n\nEven though I have put strict filters in place, the mouth of the funnel is still pretty wide and lots of great material makes it through. I still cannot keep up with the firehose.\n\n\n\n",
