<p>Now, I have to wake the device a second time, make sure FaceID happens, go the Home Screen where hopefully I’m not completely distracted by icon notifications, hope I’m pulling down from the portion of the screen that will allow me to process the notifications I was trying to process, and start again.</p>
<p>I need to reduce the number of notifications. Almost none of them need to be on my Lock Screen. Most of them aren’t adding value to my life. So noted.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently, I learned that John Philip Sousa is the composer of <em>The Liberty Bell</em>. Many of us know this as the theme music for Monty Python’s Flying Circus.</p>
<p>He has a tie to my Mid-Western region of the USA, having composed a Foshay Tower March for the self-same Foshay Tower in Minneapolis. According to legend, his orchestra played it the one time at the grand opening celebration. The check from Mr. Foshay bounced, and he never played nor published the march for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>But the reason I researched Sousa reveals a part of my psyche I have tried to keep hidden. You see, I have John Philip Sousa ear worms. Seriously. And frequently. And <em>Stars and Stripes Forever</em> figures largely here, as there are many distinct sections that all come together at the end. I listened to the whole piece just a few days ago. I forgot about the Piccolo. I smiled.</p>
<p>You see, I needed to be able to name the terror. Then, perhaps, I can come to terms with the ear worm.</p>
<p>So I found <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_marches_by_John_Philip_Sousa">the Wikipedia page. The one with all 137 of his known Marches</a>. One by one, where there are linked audio files, I listened to the intros. Nope. Nope. Nope. Not that one either. I’m far less familiar with John Philip Sousa’s œuvre than I would have guessed. With the exception of just the two marches that my grey matter seems to adore, and the one pop culture gave to me, I thought perhaps two or three more had more familiar themes than the rest.</p>
<p>Anyway, my brain also loves to fire snippets of <em>The Washington Post</em> my way from time to time, as well.</p>
<p>So, which comes first? The John Philip Sousa or the dissociation?</p>
<p>There is one more ear worm. One in a similar vein. I know its name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Sousa. But it is <em>The Star Spangled Banner</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I noticed earlier today that some of my Apple Music library changes weren&rsquo;t showing on my Apple TV. After attempting to initiate a cloud sync, Apple Music told me there was an error and it didn&rsquo;t recognize my library. What? So the fix allegedly is to turn sync off and back on. No big deal, only 42,927 items.</p>
<p>I was going to continue the re-rip project but instead I&rsquo;m waiting to see if the re-sync to the cloud actually works. No idea how long it will take. No progress bar nor item count.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I was on pins and needles for about two hours. Nothing on screen that indicates &ldquo;Success,&rdquo; but everything I was hoping to see synchronized appears to have done so.</p>
<p>I made the &ldquo;iCloud Sync Status&rdquo; column visible in the Songs view. Eventually I will need to look into the large number marked &ldquo;Duplicate&rdquo; and a not as large number marked &ldquo;Ineligible&rdquo; or &ldquo;Removed&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the issues I have already mentioned is track duplication. Many albums that I have replaced with a re-rip had included one or more duplicate tracks. It feels good to clean those out. I will have gone one by one for each CD, but that does not account for items purchased from Apple or from other sources that were imported.</p>
<p>As an incorrigible collector, I have music from many, many sources. There is some work that will continue once the CDs are all back in. In the case of cassettes or vinyl, should I try to find this music digitally? Or, should I find a way to record these in real time?</p>
<p>Not going to decide today, but I know it would involve &ldquo;recording&rdquo; a side at a time, taking those files and separating them into tracks, possibly compressing to a lossless format, and adding meta data and cover art. Maybe after I retire? Or maybe not at all. I really do enjoy having everything easily available and potentially much more portable. No idea what the future may hold.</p>

			 <p>I am avoiding articles that include the phrase “Here’s what to expect…” because I expect a company to announce everything it is prepared to announce as soon as it is ready to do so. That is enough for me. I understand that they have advertisers to service, but I’m not participating.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve spent a majority of my time today plotting out my genetic ancestry.  Remains discovered in various parts of the world have had DNA survive and have been subsequently sequenced. None of the finds are clearly direct lineage, but do match between one and three segments of my DNA and therefore we <em>share</em> ancestry. Of hundreds or more shared with the worlwide scientific community, there are 31 so far that connect with me. In this list, only one, two or three DNA segments match any of mine.</p>
<p>These are some of the places people with shared ancestry have ended their journeys. Dates are best effort estimates, not lifespans. Locations are where remains were discovered, though this doesn&rsquo;t tell the story of their origins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Meliorism</em> (Latin melior, better): the idea that progress is a real concept and humans can interfere with natural processes to improve the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would it look like to embrace pragmatic meliorism instead of cynicism?</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledging problems while focusing on solutions</li>
<li>Learning from history without being imprisoned by it</li>
<li>Maintaining high standards while accepting incremental progress</li>
<li>Combining skeptical analysis with constructive action</li>
</ul>
<p>This is harder than cynicism by orders of magnitude. It takes nuance, effort, and (critically) emotional risk. But it’s also more likely to actually improve things.</p>

			 <p>Online communities have changed my life. One put me on the current course of my life, having deepened my understanding of who I am and what I want. The second, through vulnerable sharing and thoughtful explanations has helped me understand my brain in a way I never dreamed possible.</p>
<p>Oh, and there have been so many opportunities to doom scroll as well. I&rsquo;ve fallen into thirst traps and conspiracies a-plenty.</p>
<p>But here is the thing. The communities are what you make them. It&rsquo;s just as true anywhere you may go.</p>
<p>I am going to miss TikTok. I doubt there will be anything close to it in my lifetime. I have never had an online resource show me so much of what I needed to see. So many people with ease and experience and even urgency explaining so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are many places to watch videos online. Reels and Shorts and everything else.</p>
<p>The trick, now, is to connect in a way that isn&rsquo;t <em>owned</em> by anyone other than you and me, and not subject to any prevailing political winds.</p>

			 <p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>The reason why my chats and emails and posts all seem the same is hurry.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m usually writing in a browser (as I am now), instead of a proper text editing tool. I don&rsquo;t have a workflow more sophisticated than <em>Get The Idea Out And Hit Send ™</em>.</p>
<p>Secondly, while I do one or more cursory re-reads, I&rsquo;m operating from what I know I  <em>intended</em> to write, which is often different than how my fingers hit the keys, and different still from assumptions that autocorrection tools make. I don&rsquo;t always see what isn&rsquo;t right until I see what got published or sent.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I want to strike while the iron is hot. The inspiration to write a post doesn&rsquo;t last long. And the germ of the idea that generates the post, if otherwise undocumented, may not come around again for a while. Even if it does, it will be subject to the filter called <em>The Moment Is Gone</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A long time ago, I spent time with my mom in research libraries looking at microfilm and microfiche, looking for records proving lineage. On one side of the tree we were building were real and true blood ties. On the other, the lineage of the man who adopted me as his own and gave me his family&rsquo;s name. I grew up in a blended family. Both sides contain some of the best humans I have ever known.</p>
<p>Even the history of a family name itself is fascinating. We believe we have discovered the origin in a place in what is now Poland. We have also developed relationships with folks in Europe who are actively seeking the diaspora, who wonder why so few in America seem to care.</p>
<p>I have even had the privilege of being on the ground in Sweden, with a large extended family and having the sensation of a strange place feeling at once comfortable and familiar.</p>
<p>But there was a third axis missing and a window possibly closing, which represents my lineage through my birth father. We are not close, despite his efforts. And I admit feelings of regret all the while acknowledging that I&rsquo;m trying to protect myself from more pain. In a very real way, I already lost him once.</p>
<p>So now, after so much time has passed, I am going to try to reconnect and attempt to carry forward what I can.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, because I am an introvert, I have been researching my genetics directly as it is not nearly so emotionally fraught.</p>
<p>The results are both more and less specific than I hoped. My recent genealogy is European. Full stop. But I expected results to be more concentrated in Sweden or Germany than they are. At the same time, more of my genetics are continental European. The surprise for me was the Polish and Russian. A sort of relief comes from knowing I am genetically related to people who lived in the same part of the world that my family name comes from.</p>
<p>Where family lore is concerned, a great-grandfather who came to the USA in the 20th century always claimed he was descended from Viking blood. What I have learned via 23andMe is that I share one or more segments of DNA with human remains from several Viking Era archeological sites ranging from Dublin, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, the Isle of Mann, the UK, and Denmark. These are remains not necessarily associated with local populations, but more so with trade or battle. It&rsquo;s not proof of lineage, mind you, but fascinating all the same.</p>
<p>Another thing that DNA testing does is share how you may be connected genetically with others who have used the same services. Even inside of that relatively small slice of humanity, there are thousands of people alive right now, internationally, with whom I share small segments of DNA. And that is a sobering connection to all of humanity.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about how music is a time-travel machine.</p>
<p>Today what hit me while working The Re-Rip Project and the compilations of various EDM genres is how long I spent preferring electronic music at 120 BPM or faster. For about 15 years it was my thing. It seemed like a reasonable place to end up after listening to 80&rsquo;s synth-pop, and a little Acid House, New Beat and Industrial.</p>
<p>From my contemporary reading of Mondo 2000, Rolling Stone, and Wired, I was aware of the developing Rave Culture and Club Kids. But it wasn&rsquo;t until the <em>Cool World</em> movie exposed me to a few early Moby tracks that I dove in head first.</p>
<p>It was probably the one time in my life when I felt in tune with something cool happening in pop culture. Before long the record store I worked at had a <em>Techno</em> section next to the Imports. Techno came and went, Acid Jazz and Trip-hop and Chillout all tried to happen. The term Electronica gave way to EDM. I passed through Trance and Jungle and Breakbeat and Garage and Dubstep sub-genres before I found Chill and Downtempo. Then I stopped working at places that carried music and major retail stores stopped carrying anything but Top 200 charting artists.</p>
<p>I still enjoy electronic music in doses, but I have no idea what the kids think is cool anymore, or if it&rsquo;s even a thing.</p>
<p>Also I signed up on Discogs. They have cover art for all of the obscure stuff I own.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I remember stuff wrong. Also Douglas Coupland is way overrated.</p>

			 <p>I thought that it was just the stylus that my kid broke on my turntable. The record player sat idle for years as a result.</p>
<p>I bought an upgraded stylus, which arrived today. However, after re-situating items in my setup to connect the &lsquo;table, and pulling a crate of records out of storage, I learned the drive belt was wrapped around the gears in the mechanism under the platter. Unwinding the belt and returning it to its proper position was too little, too late.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing there was probably some grinding or something stopped and was forced, unbeknownst to me, during a play session with a box of grandma&rsquo;s 45s.</p>
<p>I believe I had personally played a single record when It was initially connected. In the intervening time I had been focused on converting digital media.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;d love to play and convert analog media, but that project will have to wait.</p>

			 <p>One fun thing in the midst of my CD Re-rip project has been digging into the contents of the “Enhanced CD.”</p>
<p>For the most part, I just grab anything that has the MOV extension.</p>
<p>But it’s a window into a brief period of history when playing video on our computers was  <em>amazing</em>. Further, it made production sense to try to cram several video files into the space a song occupies, instead of delivering the content online. It would have taken many hours to download each of those small files.</p>
<p>The later Enhanced CDs really are just interfaces to launch hyperlinks to content on a server somewhere, and probably long offline by now.</p>
<p>The artists seem so young and little, though they were once giant to me.</p>

			 <p>So, I’m Gen X, and therefore potentially grumpy and old. But Teams (or name your favorite tool, my company uses the M$ stack) calls aren’t something I’m necessarily prepared to take at a moment’s notice. <em>Could you give me a heads up?</em> Unlike a phone I can pick up, with PC-based communications I have to turn on a headset and make it connect before I can answer the call.</p>
<p>I sit in a cube farm and I prefer to keep my business away from teammates who are generally good at keeping their business from me.</p>
<p>Not knowing what is happening at the other end is the reason I <em>hate</em> making phone calls or <em>any</em> calls without first sending a text message to establish availability to chat, before I’ll broach availability for a voice or video call.</p>
<p>And then I have these requests. You know the camera on your laptop is shit. You also know that everyone is looking up your nostrils, or for you multi-monitor folks, the camera is pointed at your profile or your head is only visible in the bottom 25% of the frame.</p>
<p>We are in the 21st century. Pay attention to your camera quality. Pay attention to what your camera sees. Make sure we can see you with a little bit of light. And for the love of all that’s holy, put yourself into the majority of the frame and at least try to give the appearance you’re not doing other work on the call. <em>Actually look at your camera</em> from time to time.</p>
<p>Easy remedies that cost nothing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily, move to a place with more light. Face the light.</li>
<li>Adjust your laptop lid (and therefore your laptop’s camera) to put yourself in frame, even if it means the display isn’t at the perfect angle for seeing what is on your screen during a call. Having the camera at the same height as your own eyes is great.</li>
<li>Keep your screen/lens clear of fingerprints and debris.</li>
<li>Treat the camera lens as the eye contact appropriate to the conversation and your attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a purpose-built room?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit close to the camera, not opposite.</li>
<li>Move chairbacks out of frame so remote participants feel included rather than mere observers.</li>
<li>Actually look at the camera in the same way and as much as as you would look at any in-room participant.</li>
</ul>

<p>But:</p>
<p>The Logi keyboard <em>does not Flow</em>.</p>

			 <p>I’m ripping my physical CDs one more time.</p>
<p>Really, twice each. Once ripped to WAV for Plex, a second ripped to lossless for iTunes.</p>
<p>I’m hedging my bets against Apple not letting me serve my collection locally any longer. ITunes continues to be iTunes. I can’t believe how slowly it all runs, aggravated by needing to use external storage—but it works.</p>
<p>With Plex, I have a migration path to an open source OS and commodity hardware. This is assuming Plex remains viable as a project, of course. But with WAV files I sould be able to convert to other formats with ease, and I hope that need won’t arise for years.</p>
<p>Streaming is lovely, but rights being what they are, you can’t stream everything you remember hearing.</p>
<p>Back to iTunes, of course I have made a mess of my library. I have been using iTunes Match, which is a backup of sorts, and a streaming library of sorts, and boy it helped me through a massive file loss (self-inflicted) a few years ago.</p>
<p>What iTunes Match has done, which is pretty cool in a lot of ways, is replace low-bitrate MP3 files with higher bitrate AAC files on my local PC. So, many CDs that I ripped to MP3 (when disk space was more expensive) now have better sounding files on disk than I had in, say, 2003. I started ripping to MP3 circa 1998, so you might imagine.</p>
<p>This did not go perfectly, naturally.</p>
<p>Many of my albums have matched AAC files <em>in addition to</em> some MP3 files. This inflates the number of tracks in an album. Track order is preserved, but there could be two copies of several tracks per album. Further, where re-ripping is concerned, if there is the slightest metadata difference, iTunes will not necessarily replace tracks or albums but add them as net-new.</p>
<p>So. For each “album,” my process has been to find the one I’m replacing, delete the iTunes Match downloads, then I delete the album and the files from my library altogether. Finally, I import the CD, doing a spot check of the tracklist and production year. ITunes has been doing a decent job of finding cover art. I would estimate out of the discs I’ve ripped so far, the art matched 9 times out of 10.</p>
<p>Tonight, though, I noticed an eventuality I hadn’t anticipated. With albums winking out of existence and back in, that is going to mess with the playlists I have been carefully curating since I went all-in on MacOS in 2005.</p>
<p>Remember a post ago I mentioned how I keep inventing new ways to lose information?</p>
<p>So, unless I can figure out how to export playlists from iTunes wholesale, I am going to be recording my playlists here so that I can rebuild them. This a bit like how I take a screenshot of the taskbar on one Windows PC to replicate pinned applications and organization on another.</p>
<p>Re-ripping must pause.</p>
<p>With this project, I’m repairing damage and in doing so I am creating more damage.</p>
<p>The “Smart Playlists” I believe should be self-healing. It’s the ones I have created manually, and OMG there are so many, that are going to break.</p>
<p>The plan is to create a new Playlist category here, then there will be individual titled posts per playlist, and the Archive page will collect them in one place.</p>
<p>Follow along if you like.</p>
<p>**Update</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/music/save-a-copy-of-your-playlists-mus27cd5060f/mac#:~:text=Save%20a%20copy%20of%20a%20single%20playlist%20or%20use%20it,File%20%3E%20Library%20%3E%20Export%20Library.">method to export playlists</a> in the online <em>Apple Music User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>This will make my “backup” go faster than I feared.</p>
<p>Ripping is still going to take a month of Sundays.</p>

			 <p>I had a small amount of angst about ripping CDs to WAV and not doing any conversion to a more compact format. However, seeing Plex push straight PCM to my AppleTV or DLNA to my receiver, I&rsquo;m feeling better about the decision. Plex deals with metadata with a fair amount of grace.</p>

			 <p>I use Apple Wallet functionality almost every week day, both via phone and watch. I did not know that the “bank card” in my Apple Wallet would expire independently of the physical card expiration.</p>
<p>It does. Looks like a two-year registration that must be redone, and isn’t a simple matter of updating an expiration date and CVS.</p>
<p>Apple Wallet then sent transactions to a credit card and put me over my limit. I did not note any notification anywhere the preferred bank card had expired. I’m wondering if I missed something, somehow. And I’m feeling disgruntled.</p>
<p>I only noticed at all because I went to check a balance and it was not what I expected. In the Wallet app on my iPhone, the entry for the bank card had a red expired indicator. But there was no indicator on the Wallet app icon itself. Thankfully, nothing had been declined and that was the worst of it.</p>

			 <p>I was at a company function a few days ago. A pair at the gathering approached excitedly to tell me they had walked across Reykjavik. There, they purchased and brought back a sweater, which was now being worn by one of the two. They were excited to show me because they had been told I was from Iceland.</p>
<p>Somehow there has been discussion of where I’m from, where Iceland was the answer. I’m reasonably certain it’s the unique order of consonants and vowels that constitute my full name. My name has apparently been going around without me.</p>
<p>I’m Wisconsin born, but I’m <em>from</em> Minnesota. The origin story of how I got my name, which includes the European Theatre of World War II, but does not include Iceland, is far more dramatic than the tale of where I’m from. I’m happy to tell you where I’m from. And I’m happy to tell the story of my name, which began decades before my birth.</p>
<p>The tale of how they got the sweater is a good one to tell. It was a really nice sweater. And now, they can add color, about the guy who was, <em>disappointingly</em>, not from the same place.</p>

			 <p>Photography is hard. The camera doesn&rsquo;t see how I see and certainly doesn&rsquo;t show what I&rsquo;m thinking or feeling—even though images can be powerfully expressive. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an issue with the tools. I have a lot to learn.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Pruning my email inbox, I&rsquo;m made aware again and again of how overuse of buzzwords and phrases really bothers me. It&rsquo;s my special personal problem, I know. But the word &ldquo;<em>premium</em>&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;<em>hand crafted</em>&rdquo; really bother me. I hardly had to go more than a few messages before encountering them both.</p>
<p>Premium is such a truly rare thing, and the things described as premium are not rare nor unusual. It&rsquo;s like the use of the word &ldquo;classy&rdquo; &ndash; which, in my view, is also a negative indicator or unintentionally ironic. I drive a car that has a &ldquo;Premium&rdquo; trim level. There are two more trim levels above Premium. That makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;hand-crafted&rdquo; (in contemprary use) says to me only that you weren&rsquo;t able to fully automate the process you use to make everything as close to exactly the same as possible. In other words, there was a human involved, poor you. But you use that as a selling point as if that makes your coffee or printed t-shirt somehow more remarkable than another coffee or printed tshirt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to harass you with my thoughts. I only want to push back against the copycats.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is someone, somewhere, who is going to think these terms are good idea and will launch a new campaign using them.</p>

			 <p>I wish I could tell you more about him. He was my mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s brother, a great uncle, but I never met him.</p>
<p>My grandmother said she called him &ldquo;Jumbo,&rdquo; and she was hoping I would take to the same nickname. As an awkward preteen at the time, I didn&rsquo;t want to be associated with being overweight. I didn&rsquo;t hear the love in her request.</p>
<p>From what I understand, he was 28 when killed in Germany. He had probably a 6th grade education and was a farm worker. I think he was working with his brothers on the family farm, which at one point was a fairly sizable operation. I don&rsquo;t know what loves he may have had and I don&rsquo;t think he had a family of his own.</p>
<p>I never asked my grandma or my grandpa what he was like. I believe my mom has more pictures of him than the one I have seen recently, which is a very handsome man in uniform. But even what she knows is second-hand. We know people who knew him. Or knew, because time passes and people do, too.</p>
<p>But I have his name.</p>
<p>His death, fighting for the country and values and family he loved, is part of my story.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We were going to check out a comedian&rsquo;s set after seeing a snippet on Tiktok.</p>
<p>Even though the TV audio was set as one of the Apple TV audio outputs, sound from the Apple TV was only playing via a HomePod Mini in a different room. I had to leave the YouTube app and the video I was watching to go into the system settings to set the audio output to the TV speakers only.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t fix the problem. The TV showed the volume was responding to the remote control, but there was still no sound.</p>
<p>Switching to Apple Music gave the same result. No audio. No clicks, no pops, just silence.</p>
<p>Back to system settings to restart the Apple TV.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;worked.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m getting system sounds now as I move the focus and make selections.</p>
<p>I relaunched the YouTube app to watch the video I had previously started. YouTube makes no effort to remember what was happaneing previously, not the video nor my place in it. At least the app remembered my search.</p>
<p>Now, the audio is playing correctly, but the HDMI pass-through for volume control isn&rsquo;t working. This means I have to restart my TV, via a hard power cycle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been supporting technology for a long time, and I understand everything that can go wrong. On good days I&rsquo;m grateful that everything works as well as it does as often as it does. But we aren&rsquo;t doing ourselves any favors with the complexity.</p>
<p>I have to reset both the Apple TV and the TV itself to get everything back to <em>nominal</em> operation. I&rsquo;m not doing anything unsupported, but the electronics and the software fail with alarming and disappointing regularity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder people hate technology. This is so stupid.</p>
<p>Also broken? The iPhone QR scanning functionality. Because I wanted to sign into the YouTube app without booting my laptop. The YouTube app on the Apple TV and on my iPhone are allegedly supposed to be able to detect one-another to validate my sign-in. Naturally this detection failed, even after several tries. Method two is to scan a QR code. Allegedly, the QR Scanner function from the iPhone Control Center opens links in Safari, but God help you if you have to switch away for a Multi-Factor Authentication code in a different iPhone app. Because whatever you were doing just disappeared and you have to start again. While you&rsquo;re doing so, your authenticator code times out, so that is a wholly broken system and that verification method necessarily failed. There&rsquo;s also no sharing the shortcut from the QR code to open in an instance of Safari—because apparently you&rsquo;re already there, in a way that is ephemeral beyond belief. You can leave any time you like but you can never come back.</p>
<p>Fortunately I could get a code via SMS and Apple did thoughtfully allow me to easily paste that code from the clipboard into the authenticaton screen without having to switch to the messaging app or the code generator app.</p>
<p>I get it. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the Apple TV on its own, it&rsquo;s not the TV on its own. But isn&rsquo;t it? Are these devices designed to a spec or aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. It works unless it doesn&rsquo;t. It seems so dumb that everything suddenly requires a full reset to return to normal operation.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my rant. It&rsquo;s my frustration at doing what seems to be all of the right things but still having consequences I can&rsquo;t control or remediate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the engineers who design these things can tell me why I&rsquo;m being unreasonable.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve waffled on Twitter. Disabled, re-enabled, and again just diabled cross-posting. Before the edict on barring Mastodon links in profiles, I had used Debirdify to learn that about 106 of the accounts I follow had federated accounts elsewhere. That&rsquo;s less than 10 percent of the total number of accounts I follow there. The news escaping the Twitter bubble about the owner and his policies and his actions don&rsquo;t really give me hope.</p>
<p>The interesting thing right this minute is dipping into the full federated Mastodon feed to see things I would otherwise have no idea how to find. The no-algorithm thing is cool in that sense.</p>
<p>I do think that things like boosting and likes will lead to much of the same “interaction-seeking” behavior from Twitter that can be leveraged in manipulative ways. I already see accounts whose output is primarily boosted toots, or broadcasting memes. My fear is that it&rsquo;s just a matter of time until accounts are stolen and instances get weaponized as long as there is a financial or political incentive.</p>
<p>I worry about a commercial platform hosting speech and owning access to it, when the owner talks both about free speech and lawful speech. My sense is that culturally we will be now also facing battles over <em>what is lawful speech</em>, and protecting a specific point of view as lawful and anything other as not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do see more and more accounts coming over into non-Twitter spaces. I find that interesting and exciting. I think there is value in having more than one path to information. And I fully support an individual&rsquo;s right to own their words and their art.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about half way through <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://book.micro.blog/">Indie Microblogging</a> book. I see the wisdom of using the web itself and protocols we already have as the social network. Weird, right? Using the interconnected network we already use, itself, as the social network?</p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m seeing aggregation sites (networks) as a single point of failure, and I&rsquo;m seeing diaspora as the best hope for preservation and posterity.</p>

			 <p>I have long been aware that the place in the world where I call home and feel at home is very distant from any salt water. Orient yourself in any compass direction, and despite the abundance of freshwater, I’m quite distant from ocean by any measure.</p>
<p>This week at work, I was introduced to the idea of a Land Acknowledgement. My home and my place of work are on land where other peoples were displaced through trickery and with force.</p>
<p>My last name is a place name, from a tiny hamlet in what is currently Poland. Land that was once called German, and Pomeranian Prussian, and I don’t yet know what before that. My armchair etymology suggests the name means “From the place” or something simpler.</p>
<p>Three or four generations back, my relatives come from places now called England, Sweden, Germany, or Russia</p>
<p>We came by steam ship and steam train, mostly in the early twentieth century, to the middle of the North American continent. To places freshly delineated as Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota.</p>
<p>If doing all of that work to get all of the way away from where-I’m-from was worthwhile, then I have to ask, what was it about where-I’m-from the was so undesirable? How were the fortunes spent on transport seen to be a good plan? It’s not like we got to Boston or New York City and thought that was far enough.</p>
<p>The how part of how I am here is kind of easy to answer. The why, though? That might lead to some hard and possibly triggering conversations.</p>
<p>I am neurodivergent. I think that is an answer, in a way. Because it’s not by random chance. But, ultimately, the idea that anyone can go somewhere else to be more free to be who they are is, ultimately, deeply naive.</p>
<p>If I am not free to be me, where I am, nor are you free to be you where you are, then the problem isn’t geography.</p>

		<a href="https://1-1.hjalmer.com/2022/09/04/itunes-apple-music-music-rating/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-09-04 15:42:59 -0500">Sep 4, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For tracks in my library, I actively rate them up and down, per listen. It crosses my mind often to check when I&rsquo;m into the groove. I don&rsquo;t want to lose a track in the ocean.</p>
<p><em>The Scale</em></p>
<p>0 stars = Unrated. No more, no less<br>
1 Star = I hate this song<br>
2 Stars = This song is annoying<br>
3 Stars = Meh<br>
4 Stars = I like this song and wouldn&rsquo;t mind hearing it again<br>
5 Stars = I love this song<br>
5 Stars + Heart = Please play this song on repeat until the end of time</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, generally music I purchase is rated 3 or higher, though I own compilations, soundtracks and a few albums that contain songs I do not want to hear.</p>
<p>I make an initial rating, and on subsequent listens, if I feel it should be higher or lower, I will only adjust a single star at a time, either way.</p>
<p>This makes my personal soundtrack/personal radio station very easy to listen to when I put high-rated tracks on random play.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. There are some tracks from albums I adore that don&rsquo;t make sense out of context. I&rsquo;ll typically down-rate those to a three.</p>
<p>This can be painful, it requires attention, but the outcome is the thing us tapeheads always wanted. Hours and hours of music I want to hear, the endless personal mix tape.</p>
<p>Using a heart for a track makes sense on the context of adding a streaming track to a library, but lacks the nuance that the star-rating allows. I will continue to advertise and lobby for this particular feature in iTunes/Apple Music.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Setting up iCloud on one Windows laptop actually went smoothly. Every tool did exactly what it was supposed to do. This, even though I have combined my vanity email domain with iCloud.</p>
<p>To be fair, I actually <em>send</em> email from my personal account only slightly more often than I phone people from my personal number, which is close to (but not quite) never.</p>
<p>On a desktop, this did not happen. Even with Office365 installed, the iCloud tool only synced calendars and contacts. The Apple installer told me if I need iCloud email, to set up an address online.</p>
<p>I also could not use my primary email address, which matches my AppleID, to set up my mailbox in Outlook. I had to use the original icloud.com email address, and set up an application password through my AppleID, in order to set up the service.</p>
<p>Possibly related, in the past I have used Google to host my vanity domain. Whenever the Outlook email setup wizard walked me through account setup, it wanted me to authenticate to Google. I don&rsquo;t know if that is residual in Microsoft365, or if there is something in DNS that is making Microsoft go there. I really thought I had cleaned house at my provider.</p>
<p>In the end, I can monitor my mailbox from a second Windows PC. That is what I needed. But the process took the better part of 2 hours of experimentation, including waiting several times on a &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting things ready&rdquo; message from Outlook while nothing happenned in the GUI.</p>
<p>None of the Apple machines ever have trouble, and I was aware that doing iCloud on Windows could present challenges. But when things actually behaved well on one Windows 11 machine, I had hope it might go equally well on another.</p>
<p>All of this to avoid the security hoops signing into iCloud through a web browser, or simply checking email on my phone. I want to avoid transcribing password reset links or login links. Even NVidia nags for a login for video drivers, holding some software functions hostage to it.</p>
<p>As in all things technological, some days it&rsquo;s deeply challenging to make software do the thing it is meant to do. I blame both companies for making me use wizards, and not giving me the option to set things manually. Even with the mailbox established, I cannot dig into Outlook to see what settings the software is using to connect (server names, ports, security protocols)</p>
<p>So, if you can&rsquo;t set up your iCloud mailbox in Outlook via the iCloud application, use the original icloud.com email address (me.com didn&rsquo;t work for me) to set up an IMAP account. Use an application password that you will generate at appleid.apple.com for the password. Nothing I found online says it exactly that way, especially for those of us who have the vanity email domain.</p>
<p>Lastly? You will be sending as your iCloud address, or via your default account in Outlook. I can theoretically use a reply-to address, but I think that looks sketchy.</p>

<p>Apple Music hit me with a deep cut from Human League’s <em>Dare</em> album tonight. It was a favorite album and I’m really struck how simple and spare synth pop was, compared to what we can do with production, now.</p>
<p>I probably got the cassette in those days from the Columbia Record and Tape Club. My parents signed up and my middle brother and I took turns making a selection every other month.</p>
<p>Even if every album wasn’t dear, it was the music I had. My tiny collection was well-worn and significant parts couldn’t help but make it into permanent memory through shear repetition.</p>
<p>My collection of music has grown substantially over decades and it honestly pains me that I don’t have the same familiarity with albums that I once did, though rediscovery is a pleasant thing that happens often.</p>

			 <p>Listening to a lot of Seasurfer lately. I discovered them a few years ago and was reacquainted with them again a few weeks ago. Most recent album has what would call more of a dark wave sound, more synth. Earlier albums I would call more shoegaze. But layers, distortion, reverb and harmonies all throughout</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just listened to an album from 1991 that I had forgotten about, Culture Beat&rsquo;s <em>Horizon</em>.</p>
<p>I got the cassette as a promo from a record store I worked at. Clearly it was in-store play, because it had one of the stickers we used. And it was something I liked enough to put my initial on, to claim once it was rotated out in favor of something newer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main reason I looked it up to stream. Because back then, I had to wait for it. And I kept it after a lot of exposure to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super much a statement of the time, with several tracks leaning heavily on other popular tracks and popular samples. One of the tracks was so much like <em>Pump Up the Jam</em> that a decent DJ could probably have faded between the two tracks very easily.</p>
<p>I did not buy the whole album digitally, but a few tracks stood out. Namely <em>No Deeper Meaning</em>, due to the sampling of <em>Change</em> by Tears for Fears, which still makes me squee.</p>
<p>The second half of the album, roughly Side 2, is much less caught in 1991, if still referential (if not reverential). The drums from <em>Running Up that Hill</em> in the outro was a nice touch.</p>
<p>That was a fun time machine ride.</p>

			 <p>Had a strange thing happen in October. Had a very intense dizzy spell that just did not abate. Part of the treatment involved an antibiotic for an ear infection. There was a period when I could hear nothing through my left ear. While the infection appears to have cleared, my hearing hasn&rsquo;t recovered. I can hear more than nothing, but much less than before, and oddly, at times</p>
<p>I will see ENT/Hearing specialists next month. While there may be hope of more restoration, I find myself fearing the worst.</p>
<p>And more than that, I have been feeling I haven&rsquo;t been nearly grateful enough for the joy that music brings. I haven&rsquo;t been grateful enough for the awareness of what happens in my environment that hearing brings.</p>
<p>As a side sleeper, when I sleep on my right side, I can&rsquo;t hear much at all.</p>
<p>This is all very worrying.</p>

<p>I personally have no problem with this.</p>
<p>I know people just want to hear specific songs, but I have always felt an album was a statement and was meant to be consumed as a whole unit.</p>
<p>Evidence of this from the CD era is Prince’s <em>Lovesexy</em> album. It was released with all of the songs on a single track. If you wanted to get to a specific place, you needed to fast-forward or rewind much like with older analog mediums.</p>
<p>Long story short, I support this action.</p>
<p>If you want to hear only specific songs in a specific order, as a consumer you absolutely have that power in your ability to build your own playlists.</p>

<p>A playlist I’m developing. Track order needs sorting. Linking or uniting the tracks is what I would call a rhythmic complexity, even if the time signatures aren’t unusual. If you get lost, the beat will bring you back. You’ll need a tolerance for ‘90’s and 2000’s Electronica, but other genres are included.</p>
<p>There are some low notes. I recommend over-the-ear cans or a place you can feel the noise.</p>

<li>Hilton Home2 is pet-friendly and could make a great base of operations. Our experiences in two locations were very good</li>
<li>AirBnB hosts and homes are really lovely, though mattresses on beds are uneven. I can&rsquo;t imagine how difficult it must be, to provide a good mattress yet subject it to the whims of visitors about whom nothing is known—though hotels seem to have that sussed.</li>
<li>Gentrification is a thing. Wealthy individuals and large companies swoop in, buy land and build monstrosities that block everything out for people who have lived in an area for generations, then shut them out because prices sky-rocket to cater to more wealthy people who care nothing for the area, the local population, nor the natural environment. I&rsquo;m grateful for land designated as parkland—so at least there are some limits to &ldquo;growth&rdquo;. Yes, I see how I contribute.</li>

			 <p>We had to let it go.</p>
<p>We had put in a bid on a home of a scale and from a time that I have long appreciated. We did due diligence on the house and property and learned more about regional history, architectural styles, and what it takes to be more than a homeowner, but also a caretaker or conservator.</p>
<p>Making the leap would have been exciting in all the right ways, save one: it would have tapped all of our resources and left little for the future. Despite all of the modernization we could have hoped for and a house in extraordinary condition, we would have needed half again the purchase price for remediation of issues on the property.</p>
<p>This leaves me grateful that I could have even considered the change. I am glad for what I learned. In the end I still own a lovely home in which I will continue to invest.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure this is the first song of theirs I was familiar with until I rediscovered New Wave late in the 80s. Yeah, I&rsquo;m never on time. Later in the 90s at the record store I started doing  musical archeology to understand what had blown my mind in the decade before.</p>

			 <p>My first name comes from Hjalmer Lindberg.</p>
<p>Had he lived, he would have been a great uncle.</p>
<p>In World War II, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge with the 94th infantry. He was a sniper who was killed by another.</p>
<p>The story I was told was that first, Hjalmer’s helmet was shot off. This revealed the position of the German sniper. Hjalmer quickly pivoted to return fire, but the German was faster. Hjalmer was shot in the head.</p>
<p>Many details are not known to me. A thousand questions have occurred to me after it’s too late to ask.</p>
<p>Hjalmer was very good friends in the infantry with Erich Gerloff. They had such a strong bond that they made a pact. Should one survive the other, the survivor would travel to meet the other’s family.</p>
<p>Erich’s own life had been dramatic at points. He had been born in Germany, and had crossed the Atlantic three times with his family to escape economic hardship.</p>
<p>He was captured at the Battle of the Bulge and was kept briefly at a stalag. He was on a death march when, because he spoke German well enough, German soldiers told him to get out of the line. They thought he was a spy or agent and were afraid of punishment should he be put to death at their hands.</p>
<p>Erich survived the war, rising in rank through battlefield promotions, assuming I’ve understood the details at all.</p>
<p>He also honored his pact with his friend. He travelled from New York to Wisconsin to visit the Lindbergh family in Wisconsin and proposed to one of Hjalmer’s sisters within a few days.</p>
<p>They married and had a family. Their eldest, a son, they named for Hjalmer, who they had both lost.</p>
<p>That man, the son, was on a tour of duty in Vietnam, when his sister, my mother, was pregnant with me. And she wanted her brother to know she loved him.</p>
<p>Hjalmer is my first name. Erich is my middle name.</p>

<p>Long story short:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use files to exchange this data. Use services.</p>
<p>To get contacts from Outlook (Exchange) into iOS, I used the macOS-native Contacts app. I connected to the Exchange account that had the contacts needed. Then I connected to the empty iCloud account. I selected the Exchange account, selected all of the contacts, and dragged them <em>en masse</em> to the iCloud account. In a few minutes, all of the contacts appeared in iCloud with the correct data in the correct fields. A few minutes after that, they were on the destination iPhone.</p>

			 <p>I always wanted to be a DJ, from the days I listened to my Radio Shack FM radio all day long as a boy. The people pushing out the sounds always seemed to have a finger on a pulse. They seemed to connect to something. I imagined a depth and breadth of knowledge and a currency that I&rsquo;m sure was impossible to attain in reality.</p>
<p>In the 90s I took a job at a record store, which in some ways was a sort of dream come true. I <em>thought</em> I knew about music. I was an avid consumer of what radio and MTV fed me. But it was then that my education began.</p>
<p>When techno and electronica hit, my DJ dream shifted. I wanted to play the records that moved the people in the moment. I have played with decks and mixers a teensy bit. I played with a friend&rsquo;s collection of vinyl and did my best to beat-match records during a small gathering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made lots and lots of mix tapes, that mostly no one has ever heard, but me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened is I&rsquo;ve collected a lot of music over time. I am infected by people who are enthusiastic about a genre or a scene.</p>
<p>Music is so powerful.</p>
<p>It is a giant river, life-giving and fertile like the Amazon or the Nile. Some of it is written down or recorded, where it lives in the vast ocean.</p>
<p>Just like I can&rsquo;t read every book, I can&rsquo;t hear every record.</p>
<p>I have been listening to a series of <a href="https://secrethistoryofrock.blogspot.com/2021/03/insanely-great-nineties-songs-you-arent.html">playlists</a> generated by someone close to my own age, that span years including the four that I spent at the record store.</p>
<p>Boy, is it resurfacing old thoughts and ideas and dreams.</p>
<p>The cool part is I agree with many of the selections.</p>
<p>The cool part is I&rsquo;m hearing songs I would have never heard, otherwise.</p>
<p>The cool part is there is always such good music.</p>
<p>If you do the Apple Music thing, <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/Hjalm">I&rsquo;m here</a> and I like to share.</p>

			 <p>My work day started with my awesome new Logi MX KEYS keyboard not Bluetoothing to anything, anywhere.</p>
<p>I was worried I owned a nicely-weighted, space gray brick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rechargeable and therefore sealed. The power switch didn&rsquo;t change anything. None of the key presses in the Quick Start guide changed its behavior. None of the forum posts addressed what I was seeing. So I went rogue. After a lot of searching for any mention of what I was seeing, I began experimenting with long key presses and multiple key combinations and finally got to where I could pair the keyboard to my Mac again.</p>
<p>I was able to hold the <strong>fn</strong> and <strong>F13</strong> keys to get it into pairing mode for device 1. Then, on my MacBook,  I was able to use the Bluetooth preferences in the System Settings application and subsequently the Logi Options app saw it again, as well.</p>

			 <p>Putting some thoughts here, while they are on my mind:</p>
<p>Political parties and news organizations love to pretend that an election is an ideological mandate. When the candidate you vote for wins, it&rsquo;s fun to feel that way.</p>
<p>I think an election is simpler, it&rsquo;s a snapshot in time, and it&rsquo;s very much about who is on the ballot. Sometimes a vote is yes to a candidate, to a party or to a platform, but sometimes a vote is against a specific person. I suspect that the 2016 and 2020 elections reflect this in America more than Americans traditionally would admit.</p>
<p>I think the political parties are their own machines, representing their own self-preservation and the agendas of large donors. As such, neither party in the U.S.A. would ever change anything fundamentally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that political parties represent a mandate any more than an election does.</p>
<p>I think political parties aren&rsquo;t representative of us, of We The People, because the parties generally and the candidates specifically are beholden to money.</p>
<p>I think Ranked Choice Voting is worth a try and might better represent overall preferences, or show where more of us actually agree. We really need to pay attention to what we have in common and fight hard for that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard to step outside of a bubble I have willingly been inside of for decades.</p>
<p>I used to wonder why George Carlin seemed so angry toward the end of his career. I&rsquo;m starting to understand.</p>

			 <p>Unspoken Role of Technical Support: Absorb and correct for damage created by other companies</p>
<p>Example: large ticket volume this week created by issues stemming from a large operating system vendor&rsquo;s critical updates. Some laptops are becoming unbootable and some folks are getting bluescreens simply from printing. This is all fixable, but fixes take time. None of this is a result of any decision made by anyone employed by my company.</p>

			 <p>So there&rsquo;s a music project called <a href="https://losthorizonsband.bandcamp.com/">Lost Horizons</a>—that I didn&rsquo;t know about 30 minutes ago—that features former Cocteau Twin Simon Raymonde and Richard Thomas who has drummed with Dif Jus and Jesus and Mary Chain. Their <em>In Quiet Moments</em> album includes a track called <a href="https://losthorizonsband.bandcamp.com/track/every-beat-that-passed-feat-kavi-kwai">Every Beat that Passed</a> which is the most Cocteau-Twins-like music I have heard since… Cocteau Twins. This project is no attempt to return to that sound, but that track is spectacular. The tracks I have heard from the same album have a <em>Saint Etienne</em> vibe, in that the tracks recall the 60s and 70s.</p>

			 <p>I am very pleasantly surprised with the most current release of the iOS Bullet Journal application. It is in no way designed to take the place of your paper journal. But allows you to photo your pages and assign them to a calendar day and page number inside of a journal. Another nice feature is the ability to assign a page to a Collection.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it backs up to the iOS Files application. I can use my iCloud Drive to store the backup file. No new account is required. No new subscription is needed.</p>
<p>The application fully supports the Bullet Journal methodology, but gives you a way to review your notes even if you are away from the physical copy.</p>
<p>Lastly, in a pinch, there is an ephemeral 72-hour Log for Tasks, Notes and Events. This provides a way to continue to capture until you can return to your paper Journal.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>

			 <p>I recently relistened to <em>Feels So Good</em> by Chuck Mangione. I was in search of the source of a sample. I was in the right era and close to my target, but this was a miss. Except, listening to the full album track, I really enjoyed the musicianship—not only of The Man Himself, but also of the full accompanying band. Now, of course, it&rsquo;s my current ear worm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

			 <p>What I have realized is that photos can’t capture thoughts or feelings. Not exactly. They don’t capture the love we feel, the joy of a certain moment, the sense of place we may feel, or a feeling of belonging with family or friends. They just capture the light in the moment the shutter is released by causing a chemical reaction in a film or sensors in an array to record their states.</p>
<p>In this, photographs lie to us by showing an objective truth.</p>
<p>The image evokes recollection, or the image transports us through time, or invites us into a new way of seeing, challenges notions or perspectives.</p>
<p>The art in photography is that it makes us think and feel, even though our thoughts and feelings may only be loosely related to the subjects of our gazes.</p>
<p>All this from photons, transformed, in the tiniest slices of time.</p>
<p>When I snapped this image, I had been enjoying the contrast of the dark tree limbs against the orange and amber of the sunset.</p>
<p>By the time it occurred to me to attempt to capture it, launch my camera app on my phone, and frame an image I hoped might not be hideous, the sky changed.</p>
<p>The image doesn’t show any of that. Just an amateurish shot by someone who intended well.</p>
<p>But I remember.</p>

			 <p>Deployed a new MacBook Air at work and asked my client to stay On 10.15.7 until 11.1 is released. I was hoping to avoid not-yet-known compatibility risks. I had only used a test machine for 90 minutes at work by that point.</p>
<p>Another client wanting to stay on top of security updates demonstrated the thing I feared. Printing to a Canon workgroup printer from Big Sur did not work well. Canon&rsquo;s American web site did not have macOS 15 drivers, which was not shocking. Big Sur did not want packages built for earlier versions of the OS, which was not helpful and quickly closed an avenue of inquiry.</p>
<p>Strangely, yet fortunately, Google lead me to Canon&rsquo;s Singapore Web presence. Their support pages recognized Big Sur and provided working drivers. This was very unexpected but very helpful. I was really glad because suggesting the black-and-white-only Generic PCL drivers as a work-around would not have worked well for me in that specific case.</p>
<p>My company has a tiny number of Macs. Given our embrace of the Office365 stack, I can&rsquo;t imagine there will be too many difficulties. I did not run the Big Sur beta on work equipment because in the past that prevented me from accessing my Parallels VM. Last night I was able to update my work MacBook Pro and 24-hours later I have no regrets</p>

<p>In a world whose absurdity appears to be so impenetrable, we simply must reach a greater degree of understanding among men, a greater sincerity. We must achieve this or perish. To do so, certain conditions must be fulfilled: men must be frank (falsehood confuses things), free (communication is impossible with slaves). Finally, they must feel a certain justice around them.</p>

<p>The sound was in a sweet spot for me. I heard sounds that reminded me of Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine, Swervedriver, Love and Rockets, Kitchens of Distinction, Bailter Space, and others. When I read of all the bands they have toured with, I was disappointed I hadn’t listened to them sooner. God bless streaming music!</p>
<p>I will likely be collecting their sounds.</p>

<p>I love the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Halloween_Tree"><em>The Halloween Tree</em></a> by Ray Bradbury.</p>
<p>It was one of the early young adult novels I read in my life, and possibly my first exposure to Ray Bradbury as a youth. As a boy it was the first time I had deeply considered death.</p>
<p>What I appreciated most was the historical scope and sweep of history, but I won&rsquo;t lie that I don&rsquo;t appreciate being so deeply mislead about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain">Samhain</a>. It&rsquo;s fiction, of course. An author can write what he wishes. Powerful imagery, but… wrong.</p>
<p>Yet I own paper and electronic versions.</p>
<p>It means that much to me.</p>

<p>My love affair with Danse Macabre began in elementary school. Mrs. Otten played Halloween songs on the piano and we sang from mimeographed lyric sheets.</p>
<p>I was introduced to parts of the melody via a song called the <em>Halloween Song</em>, which has stuck in my head ever since, because the refrain includes singing the letters that spell the holiday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjkh8ninN2Y">It sounded a lot like this YouTube.</a> I&rsquo;m certain my teacher played a copy of this very recording.</p>
<p>In music classes in later years we listened to the symphonic version while watching filmstrips of artistic conceptions of what the various parts of the music could represent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/music/read/danse-macabre-a-brief-history-of-halloween-s-haunting-anthem-1.5062586">Here&rsquo;s a great article from CBC</a> which includes some great background on the piece and some really enjoyable renditions including one for two pianos.</p>
<p>For me the piece is tied to Autumn and to All Hallow&rsquo;s Evening, even though it wasn&rsquo;t the intent of the composer.</p>
<p>Schools don&rsquo;t track holidays the same way as they did, a long time ago. So for my daughter, I have work to do If I want this to stick.</p>

<p>Any time we think of groups of people that include friends, neighbors and family as an enemy, I wonder if we aren&rsquo;t then the problem. I&rsquo;m including myself, here.</p>
<p>I do hereby disavow political parties. I will continue to study and learn. I will be performing my civic duty this fall to the best of my ability.</p>

An endless universe<br>
Yet we keep looking through<br>
The eyeglass in reverse<br>
Don&rsquo;t feed the people<br>

In different circles<br>
We keep holding our ground<br>
Indifferent circles<br>
We keep spinning round and round</p>

			 <p>Just finished: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780142409336">The Case of the Missing Marquess (Enola Holmes #1)</a> by Nancy Springer 📚</p>
<p>I saw that Netflix is releasing a movie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d0Zf9sXlHk">Enola Holmes</a> and I wanted to find out more. Looks like there are many books in this series so there is a possibility this could become a thing.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the story though the target audience is much younger than I.</p>

			 <p>And…the worst case? I asked.</p>
<p>“Facebook might have won already, which would mean the end of democracy in this century,” <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jaron-lanier-tech-oracle-profile">Lanier said.</a> “It&rsquo;s possible that we can&rsquo;t quite get out of this system of paranoia and tribalism for profit—it&rsquo;s just too powerful and it&rsquo;ll tear everything apart, leaving us with a world of oligarchs and autocrats who aren&rsquo;t able to deal with real problems like pandemics and climate change and whatnot and that we fall apart, you know, we lose it. That is a real possibility for this century. I&rsquo;m not saying I think it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll happen, but I wouldn&rsquo;t count it out. There&rsquo;s evidence every single day that it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.”</p>
<p>Take the amount of misinformation about masks and COVID-19 that was flying around Facebook and Twitter daily and in turn making its way onto Fox News. Most of the people who appear on air on Fox, Lanier pointed out, are themselves on social media, getting their information or lack thereof. And so disinformation goes from Twitter to Fox to the social media feeds of the president, and the cycle begins anew. Look at how powerful these platforms could be, to the point where “the sway of media is more powerful than the experience of reality—that people can be watching hundreds of thousands die from this virus and yet believe it&rsquo;s a hoax at the same time, and integrate those two things. That&rsquo;s the food for evil,” Lanier said.</p>

			 <p>For all of the talk of ecosystems, it was easier to share from my Apple Photos library to Micro.blog and to Instagram from my iPhone. Not my iPad, for which there is no native Instagram app, and for which the work-alikes did not allow multiple selections. So, while my iPhone was charging, I downloaded the iPhone app to my iPad, did the pixel doubling so I could type, and did the work that way.</p>
<p>There are probably more ways to do this, and really I wanted to do it elegantly from my MacBook Air, however I didn&rsquo;t perceive a faster method than exporting and uploading, and I chose not to do that.</p>
<p>I feel that this might be a driver behind Catayst apps and unifying the underlying silicon.</p>

			 <p>Please allow me to quote heavily from The Bard <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/tao-lin/2013/06/13-quotes-from-terence-mckenna/">Terence McKenna</a>—this selection comes from a discussion about language:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We use rapidly modulated small mouth noises. As primates we have incredible ability to make small mouth noises. We can do this for up to six hours at a stretch without tiring. No other thing we can do approaches the level of variation with low energy investment that the small mouth noises do. A person using a deaf-and-dumb language is exhausted after forty-five minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But a problem with the small mouth noises mode of communication is: I have a thought, I look in a dictionary that I have created out of my life experience, I map the thought onto the dictionary, I make the requisite small mouth noises, they cross physical space, they enter your ear, you look in your dictionary, which is different from my dictionary, but if we speak what we call ‘the same language’ it will be close enough that you will ‘sort of’ understand what I mean. Now if I don’t say to you, ‘what do I mean?’ you and I will go gaily off in the assumption that we understand each other.</p>

			 <p>Thinking about old forms of media, I am torn about attempting to digitize old formats versus (re)buying. Something like an old movie on a DVD is low hanging fruit, as is music on CDs. I&rsquo;ve long had CDs ripped and am working on movies.</p>
<p>But cassettes and vinyl—there is a labor of love. Transcribing happens in real time, then editing is necessary to separate tracks dubbed during the session&hellip;</p>
<p>There is great equipment available to do a good job of this, even for a home hobbyist.</p>

<p>Used a tape deck very much like the one pictured here. It was the first audio equipment I purchased. It played through a little amplifier I purchased in kit form and assembled in a high-school electronics class.</p>
<p>I dubbed many, many records from friends. Listened to hundreds of albums purchased new on cassette. Thousands of hours of my life are connected to this. Such an 80s artifact. It survived into the early 2000s but one too many lightning strikes to the power grid took it out. Still have the library of aging cassettes.</p>
<p>For two decades, this was a critical furnishing in any of my living spaces.</p>
<p>Listening to older music makes me think of the past.</p>
<p>The internet did not disappoint me. I was able to triangulate and find an image of the very model I used to own.</p>

			 <p>Executive Order May 29, 2020, 2020-11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/emergency-management/coronavirus-covid-19/emergency-executive-orders#May%2029,%202020-11">EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-11</a></p>
<p>I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, on May 29, 2020, pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code Section 13.06, do hereby issue the following Executive Order:</p>
<p>On May 29, 2020, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 12.29, I issued an Emergency Declaration, declaring a Peacetime Emergency due to the civil unrest occurring throughout Saint Paul.</p>
<p>Saint Paul Leg. Code Chapter 13.06(b) provides that, “whenever necessary to meet an emergency … the mayor may by executive order promulgate regulations … for which adequate regulations have not been adopted … respecting …the conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair, maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health, fire and safety regulations; and all other matters which are required to protect public safety, health and welfare in emergencies”.</p>
<p>On May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed and in the custody of officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Other Minneapolis police officers stood guard as witnesses begged the officers to provide life-saving aid to George Floyd. Civil unrest has arisen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since Mr. Floyd’s death. This civil unrest included mass protests in Minneapolis on May 26-28, 2020 which caused injuries, looting and the destruction of public and private property. This civil unrest, including looting and the destruction of property, has spread to Saint Paul as of May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020 the Saint Paul Fire Chief reported that between May 28, 2020 and May 29, 2020, the City received over 300 calls for service for fires, 126 of which were related to fire calls and 55 of which were confirmed. A curfew is necessary in order to ensure the public safety of the people of Saint Paul.</p>
<p>Governor Walz, in Executive Order 20-56, has declared a peacetime emergency in the City of Saint Paul as well as the City of Minneapolis and the “surrounding communities”. Governor Walz, as part of Executive Order 20-56, has also activated the National Guard to support in emergency operations and response. On May 29, 2020. Governor Walz issued Executive Order 20-65 implementing a night-time curfew in the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, do hereby issue the following Emergency Executive Order:</p>
<p>Night-time Curfew: effective May, 29, 2020, at 8:00 P.M. a curfew is imposed in all public places within the City of Saint Paul between the hours of 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.
Travel Prohibited. During the curfew, all persons must not travel on any public street or public place.
Exemptions. All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, and members of the news media, as well as other personnel authorized by the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol, or Minnesota National Guard, are exempt from the curfew. Individuals traveling directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing danger, or experiencing homelessness are also exempt.</p>
<p>Definitions.
a. For the purposes of this Executive Order, “travel” includes, without limitation, travel on foot, bicycle, skateboard, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, or any other mode of transporting a person from one location to another.
b. For the purposes of this Executive Order, a “public place” is any place, whether on privately or publicly owned property, accessible to the general public, including but not limited to public streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks, vacant lots, and unsupervised property.
Enforcement.
a. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 12.45, an individual who willfully violates this Executive Order is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days.
b. Any person who disobeys a lawful order of a regular member or auxiliary member of the police or fire departments enforcing this Executive Order or another person having a specific emergency management assignment and displaying their official identification enforcing this Executive Order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code 13.13.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Saint Paul Legislative Code, this Executive Order is in immediate effect upon my signature and, if not sooner rescinded or later extended, shall expire at 6:00 A.M. on May 31, 2020.</p>

He quotes physician Dr. James Hamblin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The thing is if shutdowns and social distancing work perfectly and are extremely effective it will seem in retrospect like they were totally unnecessary overreactions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and epidemiologist Mari Armstrong-Hough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You won’t ever know if what you did personally helped. That’s the nature of public health. When the best way to save lives is to prevent a disease rather than treat it, success often looks like an overreaction.”</p>

		<a href="https://1-1.hjalmer.com/2019/12/28/how-i-made-twitter-enjoyable/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-28 18:30:00 -0500">Dec 28, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have transitioned to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> as my primary online presence, but I still have my Twitter account. While I have often entertained leaving it altogether, I still wish to keep my handle. I have also found that with thoughtful curation, it&rsquo;s still a place to learn new things about the world and to be excited by new people and topics.</p>
<p>One big change came after applying a suggestion from <a href="https://micro.blog/patrickrhone">@patrickrhone</a>. He announced that he had turned off retweets for accounts he follows. This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context. It takes more time to share tweets this way, so the tweets shared in this fashion are more meaningful. It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.</p>
<p>Retweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more.</p>
<p>A second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one&rsquo;s own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don&rsquo;t see much from those same people.</p>
<p>And lastly, there is that curation thing. I don&rsquo;t love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that. When accounts make me angry or sad, I simply unfollow. When I can no longer tell why I followed a specific account, I unfollow. When I see accounts that appear to be trolling or are otherwise propagating falsehoods because they can, I block. Easy.</p>
<p>Curating also can be applied from areas of interest or study or self-improvement. Writers whose work appears in places that excite me are easy follows. Artists whose work I admire are easy follows. Companies doing work I&rsquo;m interested in are easy follows. Individuals committed to causes dear to me are easy follows. But all of the filters above apply.</p>
<p>Even though I have put strict filters in place, the mouth of the funnel is still pretty wide and lots of great material makes it through. I still cannot keep up with the firehose.</p>

			 <p>A lesson I have not learned is that I affect the people I live with my moods and actions. Not intending to cause harm is not the same as not causing harm. And not saying every stupid thing doesn’t mean I won’t say small things stupidly.</p>
<p>I haven’t learned how to intercept my feelings more quickly. I haven’t learned how let the emotions flow without being swept up in them.</p>
<p>Sometimes things are spinning sideways pretty spectacularly before I understand that I am the spinner.</p>
<p>It is humbling to recognize the work in front of me to be better.</p>

			 <p>Writing is terrifying, isn’t it?</p>
<p>I mean, when you over-think it, as I am inclined to do.</p>
<p>I have a good vocabulary. I know I can do a good job constructing sentences and paragraphs. I have many great places to record my thoughts.</p>
<p>But it’s my internal editor whose objections are the hardest to overcome.</p>
<p>“Everybody has already said that.”<br>
“Everybody is going to hate it if you say that.”<br>
“What if that’s an idea that will become terribly unpopular in three years? Am I going to be allowed to evolve?”<br>
“Is this going to affect my job if my co-workers see this?”</p>
<p>So please forgive the milquetoast as I get over myself. I know these thoughts do not make me unique in any way.</p>
<p>I have deep admiration for those who write and create regularly, revealing themselves and showing vulnerability.</p>
<p>I am grateful to you for lighting the way.</p>

			 <p>I watched two movies about the Apollo Space Program this weekend.</p>
<p>The experience is very complex for me, emotionally. The experience of writing this post is an attempt to define what it means.</p>
<p>I had read recently about a film that was making its way through festivals and Friday I tried to figure out what it was called. But I might be wrong about its provenance. And while I couldn’t remember a title or find what I thought I was looking for, I did find some documentaries available online which seemed to cover similar ground.</p>
<p>The first documentary is called <em>For All Mankind</em>. It was released in 1989, several years after the <em>Challenger</em> disaster.</p>
<p>It was about all of the lunar missions, though the footage and narration was respective to the individual missions.</p>
<p>I found myself full of the same wonder today as I have always had.</p>
<p>In my lifetime, there has always been a space program. For a while, while I was younger, I believed there would be an opportunity for me to at least get to orbit. After all, at Christmastime in my first year of life, we orbited the moon. And not long after that, mission after mission got us to the surface of the moon itself.</p>
<p>When the Shuttle program was announced, I felt it was a natural progression. <em>Of course</em> we were going to have space planes. Of course we were going to find ways to make space travel easier and less expensive.</p>
<p>I remember well in my senior year of high school when <em>Challenger</em> failed. I felt disbelief and horror. My Chemistry teacher had submitted ideas for experiments to be carried aloft on that flight. One of my classmates figured out early on that an easy way to derail his lectures was to ask about the space program and his chances. I loved it. My chemistry teacher did, too.</p>
<p>I checked out books from the school library full of illustrations and speculations about what space craft might look like. What would space stations be used for? Would we build colonies in space? Could we survive on other planets?</p>
<p>It seemed, once, like there might have been an imperative. So many books and TV series and movies that I consumed pointed up to the sky and out of the solar system. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Six-Million Dollar Man, Star Trek, Space 1999, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, Star Wars, Cosmos, Alien, Cosmos, even Blade Runner, all showed me this was not only possible but normal.</p>
<p>And so, the footage re-assembled in <em>For All Mankind</em> returned the feeling of wonder and the sense of the imperative to me. And I have missed that. As much as the movie is about the missions, it also is a fun window into a brief time and place.</p>
<p>The second film I found is <em>In the Shadow of the Moon</em>. This is a much different film. While it is about the same events in the Apollo missions, the context and the subject is the recollection of the experience by many of the surviving astronauts. How they felt about their roles and what they remembered about their thoughts as events transpired.</p>
<p>I learned that the astronauts themselves were involved in the design of the craft they flew. I learned that astronauts were on the ground working as part of mission control as the missions were in progress.</p>
<p>And I learned the astronauts were taken by the perception of people around the world that we all were a part of the missions, that the success of the missions belongs to all of humanity. They have been greeted for the rest of their lives not with “You did it!” but rather with “We did it!”</p>
<p>I was profoundly struck by the final few minutes when clearly the astronauts were asked how they were affected, and how their perspective has changed. I found it deeply moving and I don’t want to spoil it for anyone considering watching it.</p>
<p>I’d definitely re-watch either film. For me it was very bittersweet. I hope someday we can stop poking at each other for sport. I hope someday we can take stock of the amazing gifts we have and consider the what we can leave behind for those generations we will never know.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
<p>The movie I had read about is called <em>Apollo 11</em>. It&rsquo;s going to be released first in IMAX, then in traditional theatres shortly thereafter.</p>

<li>Food item: Intended to bring for lunch. I <em>did</em> bring two out of three things that I intended to bring, but  I am frustrated that I did not verify what I had with me before I left the house.

			 <p>I’m casting my lot with <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lost for a long time after I moved away from Palm Pilots. I never really got traction in Outlook or PlanPlus on the software side. I have flirted with Things, OmniFocus, Microsoft ToDo, Wonderlist, Informant, ToodleDo, Evernote, Tasks and Notes.</p>
<p>On the paper side I&rsquo;ve tried Franklin-Covey methodology, I&rsquo;ve carried Midori travel notebooks and I have tried Bullet Journaling.</p>
<p>I love paper. I love pencils. I love fountain pens. I found a roller ball pen that I like using that won&rsquo;t explode or break in my pockets.</p>
<p>I found out I like grid-lined notebooks but I love dot-grid even more. I found out I don’t love the shape of Midori paper, I prefer A4 and A5 sized notepads and notebooks. <em>Leuchtterm</em> and <em>Scribbles that Matter</em> make notebooks that are wonderful companions. Skip the decorative layouts from YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram. Stick to <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn">The System</a>.</p>
<p>I’m good at capture on paper but really bad at follow-through and prioritizing. And especially bad at keeping important things from previous days in front of me. This is my biggest opportunity.</p>
<p>So, wow, tools have really become much better. I understand what I want to accomplish better. And and ideas from Bullet Journaling really translate to software in ways I wouldn&rsquo;t have understood without taking my second Oddyssey through journaling on paper. This makes me happy.</p>
<p>I still have to do the work, but I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>The next quest is for software I can keep in my phone to help with habit-tracking, tracking meals, tracking moods and other health characteristics. I have a lot of changes to make.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to suggestions on places to look and methods to explore.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about supporting technology. In my career, my tendency to experiment and to follow my curiousity has been rewarded. Experimenting has enabled me to understand where there are real limits and risks, and has helped me to understand steps I can take to protect myself and steps I can take to recover. Going through these kinds of exercises repeatedly has removed fear and uncertainty and increased confidence.</p>
<p>Even though we all click on things and type, experimentation with technology is not a part of most professions. Some only deal with technology in a strict, procedure-driven sense. Failure to follow procedure leads to negative consequences.</p>
<p>Until recently, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that one reason that people will not reach out for assistance with technology is  the fear of being perceived either as ignorant or incompetent to perform their jobs. These are people who otherwise have great amounts of experience, expertise, and wisdom in their vocation, but who feel thwarted by tools that seem impenetrable or incomprehensible, yet are presented as critical.</p>
<p>As technologists, we are just not trained to understand there are very human and emotional reasons that technology might not work. Emotions and culture affect all of our interactions, from simple break-fix support  to the largest enterprise projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in changing what I do, and how I do it, to increase the benefit. I&rsquo;m interested in starting with that awareness, instead of compensating with re-work later, or wondering why a project failed if the technology was seemingly rational or the right thing to implement.</p>

			 <p>I have carried multiple communication devices several times in my career, including for the past 5 years at my current employer. My rationalization initially was to separate support calls from my personal life. A second benefit was to use a second carrier on different spectrum to ensure strong signal.</p>
<p>Logistically, that&rsquo;s two devices on my person. Two Apple IDs. Two places for notifications to acknowledge. Two calendars. Two devices to update and to charge every day. More stuff to pack when I travel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not two people. I understand now that the extra effort is a distraction from more importal goals and work. I&rsquo;m not Work Hjalmer and Home Hjalmer. I&rsquo;m Hjalmer.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m simplifying to a single device: Transitioning this weekend, then cutting service for the second number this week.</p>
<p>For folks in my personal life, I&rsquo;m keeping the number I&rsquo;ve had since about 2002. For my work colleagues, stay tuned for updates through official channels.</p>

			 <p>In my professional life, problem-solving with technology, I almost always start with a set of assumptions and base my initial actions on those. If I&rsquo;m lucky, I&rsquo;m right. A rote solution works.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not lucky, I still win. I learn a new method, or a new perspective, or new patience. My knowledge in some respect will deepen. I have the relative luxury of rebuilding my model of the problem and restarting steps to resolution.</p>
<p>I have finally understood that this same approach in personal relationships is so wrong and so ineffective. It&rsquo;s best to start with no assumptions. No reactions. And no talking until I get it.</p>
<p>And I suppose here, too, I&rsquo;ve had the luxury of people tolerant of my quirks.</p>
<p>I thought I knew how to listen, but I see I can do better.</p>
<p>And then I need to ask, is there more I should know?</p>

			 <p>Listening to Bill Laswell at the moment. I&rsquo;m nowhere close to a completist, but that is a deep vein to mine. Today, I pulled up his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Laswell">Wikipedia article</a>. <em>Holy Cats</em> is that man prolific.</p>
<p>The credo of his former Axiom record label is &ldquo;Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is described on the <a href="http://www.mod-technologies.com/">M.O.D. Technologies</a> record label pages as an iconoclast.</p>
<p>That sings to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of his solo work, as well as the <em>Material</em> and <em>Golden Palominos</em> projects.</p>

			 <p>My taste in music is unconventional. People have been telling me for a very long time that music that moves me is wierd or hard to enjoy. This saddens me deeply, so I am giving you that out before you read this or anything else I write about music.</p>
<p>Today I am all about Recoil&rsquo;s 2000 album, <em>Liquid</em>. I am a big fan of the spoken-word delivery of most of the tracks, and a big fan of the electronica that is the basis of it all—though in the style of music it is most certainly a product of its time. The staccato percussion and the deep, groovy bass is a wonderful counterpoint to the smooth, stylish, and sometimes whispered vocals.</p>
<p>I went to check the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_(Recoil_album)">wikipedia entry</a> for the album release date and was astonished as I had forgotten about all of the collaborators who contributed their art.</p>
<p>My favorite track by far is called <em>Want</em>. It features words written by performance artist or “broken word” performer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Blackman">Nicole Blackman</a>. It speaks of desire, but reaches deeply and frankly into our darkness. It gives voice to thoughts we might otherwise chase away.</p>
<p>In 2010 Recoil released remixed versions of <em>Want</em> and <em>Jezebel</em> from the Liquid album (which thrilled me to no end) as well as an arresting video set to my favorite remix version. The video has a compelling narrative of its own, which is not about the lyric, but which comes from the same dark territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ebppvoBlK_E">Want (Renegade of Noise 808)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cpeP5eLklZ4">Want (album version)</a></p>
<p>If you can find beauty in the darkness, you may really love the tracks. If I&rsquo;ve lost you, I&rsquo;ve probably really lost you.</p>

			 <p>Today I learned, or maybe I relearned, that the reason there aren&rsquo;t Word or Excel templates for an hourly look at your week&rsquo;s schedule is because Outlook offers that as one of the ways to print your own calendar.</p>
<p>On the Mac, I found the version of the weekly calendar from the Calendar app to be superior to the wierd, unfinished output in the first-ring version of Outlook 2016 I&rsquo;m running there.</p>
<p>My quest was driven by my newish habit of carrying a dot-grid notebook. With it, I&rsquo;m doing much better at task capture than without it. And,yes, I know: there are a thousand so-called Bullet Journal (BuJo) bloggers and vloggers with lots of decorative and/or practical layouts I could draw trace or tape into my journal.</p>
<p>But, if, instead, I can simply print from an application I have open all-day, every-day, then I feel like that is a win.</p>
<p>It would be more perfect if I could print on A4, but I will take what I can get.</p>

<p>I would never have guessed anywhere near this number of detonations, ever.</p>
<p>What is the longterm legacy in our environment?</p>
<p>A big question I have is whether there is a correlation between the number of these devices set off and the heat in our atmosphere. If a single volcano can change global temperatures for years, what is the net effect of the waste heat and radiation generated by more than two thousand of these?</p>

			 <p>There is no end to discovery in music.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have been listening to <em>Pink Moon</em> by Nick Drake on repeat for about the last two hours. Just the one song, which is something I rarely do.</p>
<p>I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/"><em>The Lake House</em></a> on TV last night, and it was featured in the soundtrack. And I remembered that it was in Volkswagen convertible commercials a long time ago. Maybe ten years ago? I had assumed at that time that it was a current song by a current commercial artist. You know, because Volkswagen and Mitsubishi had been using Crystal Method, Dirty Vegas and Propellerheads tracks. I won’t lie: I have purchased albums on the basis of television commercials.</p>
<p>But hearing it again made it fresh and I was determined this time to find it and download it.</p>
<p>It’s not on the soundtrack album for <em>The Lake House</em>. Fortunately, IMDB lists the songs in the movie, in what I&rsquo;m guessing is order of appearance.</p>
<p>I made a lot of wrong guesses as to which song it might be, because I didn’t think through the lyrics as they related to the song title. And I assumed incorrectly the song was from the late 90s.</p>
<p>SO. If he was still alive, I would owe Nick Drake an apology. And I find myself wondering what the rest of his œuvre is like. <em>Pink Moon</em> is the title track of his third album, released in 1972. He didn&rsquo;t live long enough to produce a fourth.</p>
<p>It’s a sweet, stripped down, two-minute song. Two guitars and a few notes on a piano, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a few lines of poetry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> repeated twice:</p>

			 <p><em>Kim and Jessie</em> is a song that I can easily put on repeat.</p>
<p>M83’s last two albums have been trending toward a sound that is very nostalgic for me, and this particular song is a stand out example.</p>
<p>Though the song was released in 2008, it is heavily evocative of mid-1980s groups like ’Til Tuesday, Flock of Seagulls, and Tears for Fears. If you played a string of Top 40 hits from 1985 or 1986, and slipped in <em>Kim and Jessie</em>, I think a lot of people would think it sounds similar and familiar. Whether that makes you die inside a little or makes you a little giddy is personal, of course.</p>
<p>The lyric is simple, and most of the song is repetition of the chorus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody lurks in the shadows<br>
Somebody whispers<br>
Somebody lurks in the shadows<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the repetition of the lyric in the last part of the song really works for me, because it gives me a chance to notice the additional vocal parts and the simultaneous guitar solo which are layered subtly, not detracting from the melody but awaiting your attention.</p>
<p>I had not seen the video until just before writing this piece. While it doesn’t sync to the lyric, I think it tells a similar story that is equally open to interpretation.</p>

			 <p>Tonight, I signed up for Amazon&rsquo;s free cloud player service—specifically because of news items I read about Amazon&rsquo;s new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AutoRip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service.</p>
<p>AutoRIP is something that ought to have been done a long time ago. If you buy a qualifying CD, subject to the terms of licensing between Amazon and the major record labels, you get the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shipped to your house and you get an electronic copy placed in your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon Cloud Player<!-- raw HTML omitted --> library. These electronic copies are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->back-dated<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well. Amazon says any qualifying CD purchase since 1998 also (eventually) will be put into your Cloud Player.</p>
<p>So, naturally, I had to sign up for the free account. As an aside, I learned that you can store 250,000 tracks in your cloud player for $25 per year. This is ten times the music that iTunes Match allows for the same price. I find myself tempted to store music here, too. (<em>This has changed. iTunes Match allows 100,000 tracks</em>)</p>
<p>Of the few CDs that Amazon initially has put into my Cloud Player library is a CD I purchased in November of 2004 by an artist whose name I am not familiar with. In fact I do not even know where I would have heard about the album at all. What&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t see the CD on my shelving which is a concern because I try to strictly alphabetize by artist and album.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean I never had it. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the album isn&rsquo;t associated with my Cloud Player account by mistake, either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have binged and purged music, bought, sold, gifted and traded. But this one just doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell at all.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Most of the discs I&rsquo;ve bought have been via Amazon&rsquo;s web site, but actually were purchased from a lot of private sellers. So those will never show up via AutoRip and therefore I am sad.</p>

			 <p>I have a large iTunes library. It doesn&rsquo;t represent everything I have ever heard, nor everything I have ever loved, nor even everything I own. But that iTunes library is becoming a beast to manage.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is SO much data about the music—that isn&rsquo;t the music—but is integral.</p>
<p>Recently I have made it a personal project to make sure a single piece of information exists for each track: the release date, the day it became available for sale to the public.</p>
<p>I began this project because I was completely dismayed at the amount of music I have imported into my library without a date at all, and also frustrated by the number of albums imported with a re-release date instead of the original release date. The re-release date to me is like restoring a 1966 Ford Mustang and then saying it is a current-year Ford Mustang. No. Therefore, even when an album is remastered a second or third time, it is still a product of its era.</p>
<p>The release date is important to me. I remember where and when a piece of music was first a part of my life. I remember the order albums were released by favorite artists. So, when I sort my library by date, I want it to match that experience. For example, when I was a Freshman in high school, there was a radio show from midnight to 2 AM on Monday mornings where I first heard <em>Mad World</em> by Tears for Fears. This is opposed to the first time I heard <em>Shout</em>, also by Tears for Fears. I was a Junior in high school by then. I walked into Musicland in the Ridgedale mall in Minnetonka, Minnesota. It was playing in store and I bought the cassette on the spot. So my iTunes library had better get it right.</p>
<p>Aside: In the movie High Fidelity, the protagonist spends significant time sorting his collection of albums chronologically by relationship. <em>This makes enormous sense to me</em>.</p>
<p>Back to data: that raw list of data—disembodied though it is from the music—is becoming something I refer to much as I used to refer to liner notes, those tiny cassette j-cards, or the somewhat larger CD booklets. I don&rsquo;t always remember the details, so I want iTunes to be true.</p>
<p>Another case where I find date information jarring is with “greatest hits” or other career-spanning collections of songs. The date associated with a song in this case is often the release date of the collection. Yet, that date might be decades removed from when a song in the collection was originally released. This is important to me because I have playlists built by decade. When I am hearing <em>Can&rsquo;t Get You Out Of My Head</em>, which Kylie Minogue released in 2002 (in the US), I don&rsquo;t necessarily want the next track I hear to be <em>Mother&rsquo;s Little Helper</em> just because the Rolling Stones' “Forty Licks” compilation was also released in 2002.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it took the “Forty Licks” compilation to make me realize I am a bigger &lsquo;Stones fan than I thought, particularly with material released before 1970. I also now have a more profound respect for their career longevity. They are still making music.</p>
<p>So, in my iTunes library, the songs from “Forty Licks” all reflect the year they were released as singles, with the exception of the four tracks that appear nowhere else—those tracks stay in 2002, though I did for a long time consider dating them from the sessions in which they were recorded. <em>I have reconsidered this position repeatedly</em>.</p>
<p>There are still about 3,000 items in my library that are un-dated.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on missing or incorrect album art.</p>
<p>I will be researching music for a long time to come.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t claim any special privilege, knowledge, education or access. Like many friends, and friends I haven&rsquo;t met, I simply love music.</p>
<p>I got my first portable FM radio somewhere around the Christmas of 1978, and I have been trying to carry music everywhere with me ever since. It means that much to me.</p>
<p>In 1990 I went to work at a record store. You see, I thought I knew about music. I had been actively listening to radio and watching MTV and going to other record stores. I must have had a few hundred cassettes and dozens of LPs and dozens of CDs by then.</p>
<p>I found out that I didn&rsquo;t know much. The next four years blew my head open, again and again. The reality was, despite what I knew, the information flowed in reverse: I was learning from customers and coworkers. I was forced to confront my many biases because they got in the way.</p>
<p>I learned that the amount of beautiful music never played on radio, never on TV shows, never in movies, never in clubs, is astonishing. In fact, it is overwhelming.</p>
<p>It is impossible to keep up, to keep current, to be aware of all scenes, or to keep just one scene alive.</p>
<p>Music is a vast and deep ocean. Changing a perspective just slightly cracks open new ways to appreciate what you hear, to develop a feel for where it came from and for why it must be. Look at genealogies and chronologies of influences and genres. Consider political movements, cultural identity and social issues. Look at how technology has affected everything: production, performance, distribution, storage, spectacle, and ultimately what it means to be an artist.</p>
<p>What is harder to explain, and what makes music so deeply personal, is that <em>something</em> in a musical passage that sends chills up your spine, the lyric that always makes your voice break, or that sound that insists that you must move.</p>
<p>I hope to write about all of those things. But I warn you I probably won&rsquo;t do it in any sort of ordered or organized fashion. I hope to impart a sense of wonder. And I hope that I keep learning.</p>
<p>Note: Because Billy Joel once lamented “…You can&rsquo;t get the sound because it&rsquo;s only in a magazine…” (<em>It&rsquo;s Still Rock and Roll to Me</em> from <em>Glass Houses</em>), I hope to provide links to lyrics and videos where they exist and when appropriate.</p>
