<p>A second song Shuffle Play dredged up that I haven&rsquo;t heard in a very long time. I&rsquo;m sure this is the first song of theirs I was familiar with until I rediscovered New Wave late in the 80s. Yeah, I&rsquo;m never on time. Later in the 90s at the record store I started doing  musical archeology to understand what had blown my mind in the decade before.</p>

<p>Frankly, I unashamedly revisit the past frequently via music. It&rsquo;s my favorite form of time travel.</p>

<p>To all the fathers, to all the people who have fathers, to all the people contemplating becoming fathers, this day is richly varied, emotionally. I‚Äôm sure my experiences and yours overlap at least a little. I feel you.</p>

<p>If anything, being a father has shown me so many ways to improve who I am and what I do in the world. It is supremely humbling.</p>

<p>On this day, I wish you peace, joy, and love.</p>

         	<p>My first name comes from Hjalmer Lindberg.</p>

<p>Had he lived, he would have been a great uncle.</p>

<p>In World War II, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge with the 94th infantry. He was a sniper who was killed by another.</p>

<p>The story I was told was that first, Hjalmer‚Äôs helmet was shot off. This revealed the position of the German sniper. Hjalmer quickly pivoted to return fire, but the German was faster. Hjalmer was shot in the head.</p>

<p>Many details are not known to me. A thousand questions have occurred to me after it‚Äôs too late to ask.</p>

<p>Hjalmer was very good friends in the infantry with Erich Gerloff. They had such a strong bond that they made a pact. Should one survive the other, the survivor would travel to meet the other‚Äôs family.</p>

<p>Erich‚Äôs own life had been dramatic at points. He had been born in Germany, and had crossed the Atlantic three times with his family to escape economic hardship.</p>

<p>He was captured at the Battle of the Bulge and was kept briefly at a stalag. He was on a death march when, because he spoke German well enough, German soldiers told him to get out of the line. They thought he was a spy or agent and were afraid of punishment should he be put to death at their hands.</p>

<p>Erich survived the war, rising in rank through battlefield promotions, assuming I‚Äôve understood the details at all.</p>

<p>He also honored his pact with his friend. He travelled from New York to Wisconsin to visit the Lindbergh family in Wisconsin and proposed to one of Hjalmer‚Äôs sisters within a few days.</p>

<p>They married and had a family. Their eldest, a son, they named for Hjalmer, who they had both lost.</p>

<p>That man, the son, was on a tour of duty in Vietnam, when his sister, my mother, was pregnant with me. And she wanted her brother to know she loved him.</p>

<p>Hjalmer is my first name. Erich is my middle name.</p>

<p>Long story short:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t use files to exchange this data. Use services.</p>

<p>To get contacts from Outlook (Exchange) into iOS, I used the macOS-native Contacts app. I connected to the Exchange account that had the contacts needed. Then I connected to the empty iCloud account. I selected the Exchange account, selected all of the contacts, and dragged them <em>en masse</em> to the iCloud account. In a few minutes, all of the contacts appeared in iCloud with the correct data in the correct fields. A few minutes after that, they were on the destination iPhone.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I always wanted to be a DJ, from the days I listened to my Radio Shack FM radio all day long as a boy. The people pushing out the sounds always seemed to have a finger on a pulse. They seemed to connect to something. I imagined a depth and breadth of knowledge and a currency that I&rsquo;m sure was impossible to attain in reality.</p>

<p>In the 90s I took a job at a record store, which in some ways was a sort of dream come true. I <em>thought</em> I knew about music. I was an avid consumer of what radio and MTV fed me. But it was then that my education began.</p>

<p>When techno and electronica hit, my DJ dream shifted. I wanted to play the records that moved the people in the moment. I have played with decks and mixers a teensy bit. I played with a friend&rsquo;s collection of vinyl and did my best to beat-match records during a small gathering.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made lots and lots of mix tapes, that mostly no one has ever heard, but me.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happened is I&rsquo;ve collected a lot of music over time. I am infected by people who are enthusiastic about a genre or a scene.</p>

<p>Music is so powerful.</p>

<p>It is a giant river, life-giving and fertile like the Amazon or the Nile. Some of it is written down or recorded, where it lives in the vast ocean.</p>

<p>Just like I can&rsquo;t read every book, I can&rsquo;t hear every record.</p>

<p>I have been listening to a series of <a href="https://secrethistoryofrock.blogspot.com/2021/03/insanely-great-nineties-songs-you-arent.html">playlists</a> generated by someone close to my own age, that span years including the four that I spent at the record store.</p>

<p>Boy, is it resurfacing old thoughts and ideas and dreams.</p>

<p>The cool part is I agree with many of the selections.</p>

<p>The cool part is I&rsquo;m hearing songs I would have never heard, otherwise.</p>

<p>The cool part is there is always such good music.</p>

<p>If you do the Apple Music thing, <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/Hjalm">I&rsquo;m here</a> and I like to share.</p>

         	<p>My work day started with my awesome new Logi MX KEYS keyboard not Bluetoothing to anything, anywhere.</p>

<p>I was worried I owned a nicely-weighted, space gray brick.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rechargeable and therefore sealed. The power switch didn&rsquo;t change anything. None of the key presses in the Quick Start guide changed its behavior. None of the forum posts addressed what I was seeing. So I went rogue. After a lot of searching for any mention of what I was seeing, I began experimenting with long key presses and multiple key combinations and finally got to where I could pair the keyboard to my Mac again.</p>

<p>I was able to hold the <strong>fn</strong> and <strong>F13</strong> keys to get it into pairing mode for device 1. Then, on my MacBook,  I was able to use the Bluetooth preferences in the System Settings application and subsequently the Logi Options app saw it again, as well.</p>

<p>Phew.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Putting some thoughts here, while they are on my mind:</p>

<p>Political parties and news organizations love to pretend that an election is an ideological mandate. When the candidate you vote for wins, it&rsquo;s fun to feel that way.</p>

<p>I think an election is simpler, it&rsquo;s a snapshot in time, and it&rsquo;s very much about who is on the ballot. Sometimes a vote is yes to a candidate, to a party or to a platform, but sometimes a vote is against a specific person. I suspect that the 2016 and 2020 elections reflect this in America more than Americans traditionally would admit.</p>

<p>I think the political parties are their own machines, representing their own self-preservation and the agendas of large donors. As such, neither party in the U.S.A. would ever change anything fundamentally.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that political parties represent a mandate any more than an election does.</p>

<p>I think political parties aren&rsquo;t representative of us, of We The People, because the parties generally and the candidates specifically are beholden to money.</p>

<p>I think Ranked Choice Voting is worth a try and might better represent overall preferences, or show where more of us actually agree. We really need to pay attention to what we have in common and fight hard for that.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s really hard to step outside of a bubble I have willingly been inside of for decades.</p>

<p>I used to wonder why George Carlin seemed so angry toward the end of his career. I&rsquo;m starting to understand.</p>

Their <em>In Quiet Moments</em> album includes a track called <a href="https://losthorizonsband.bandcamp.com/track/every-beat-that-passed-feat-kavi-kwai">Every Beat that Passed</a> which is the most Cocteau-Twins-like music I have heard since‚Ä¶ Cocteau Twins. This project is no attempt to return to that sound, but that track is spectacular. The tracks I have heard from the same album have a <em>Saint Etienne</em> vibe, in that the tracks recall the 60s and 70s.</p>

         	<p>I am very pleasantly surprised with the most current release of the iOS Bullet Journal application. It is in no way designed to take the place of your paper journal. But allows you to photo your pages and assign them to a calendar day and page number inside of a journal. Another nice feature is the ability to assign a page to a Collection.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it backs up to the iOS Files application. I can use my iCloud Drive to store the backup file. No new account is required. No new subscription is needed.</p>

<p>The application fully supports the Bullet Journal methodology, but gives you a way to review your notes even if you are away from the physical copy.</p>

<p>Lastly, in a pinch, there is an ephemeral 72-hour Log for Tasks, Notes and Events. This provides a way to continue to capture until you can return to your paper Journal.</p>

<p>Lovely.</p>

         	<p>I recently relistened to <em>Feels So Good</em> by Chuck Mangione. I was in search of the source of a sample. I was in the right era and close to my target, but this was a miss.

         	<p>What I have realized is that photos can‚Äôt capture thoughts or feelings. Not exactly. They don‚Äôt capture the love we feel, the joy of a certain moment, the sense of place we may feel, or a feeling of belonging with family or friends. They just capture the light in the moment the shutter is released by causing a chemical reaction in a film or sensors in an array to record their states.</p>

<p>In this, photographs lie to us by showing an objective truth.</p>

<p>The image evokes recollection, or the image transports us through time, or invites us into a new way of seeing, challenges notions or perspectives.</p>

<p>The art in photography is that it makes us think and feel, even though our thoughts and feelings may only be loosely related to the subjects of our gazes.</p>

<p>All this from photons, transformed, in the tiniest slices of time.</p>

<p>When I snapped this image, I had been enjoying the contrast of the dark tree limbs against the orange and amber of the sunset.</p>

<p>By the time it occurred to me to attempt to capture it, launch my camera app on my phone, and frame an image I hoped might not be hideous, the sky changed.</p>

<p>The image doesn‚Äôt show any of that. Just an amateurish shot by someone who intended well.</p>

<p>But I remember.</p>

         	<p>Deployed a new MacBook Air at work and asked my client to stay On 10.15.7 until 11.1 is released. I was hoping to avoid not-yet-known compatibility risks. I had only used a test machine for 90 minutes at work by that point.</p>

<p>Another client wanting to stay on top of security updates demonstrated the thing I feared. Printing to a Canon workgroup printer from Big Sur did not work well. Canon&rsquo;s American web site did not have macOS 15 drivers, which was not shocking. Big Sur did not want packages built for earlier versions of the OS, which was not helpful and quickly closed an avenue of inquiry.</p>

<p>Strangely, yet fortunately, Google lead me to Canon&rsquo;s Singapore Web presence. Their support pages recognized Big Sur and provided working drivers. This was very unexpected but very helpful. I was really glad because suggesting the black-and-white-only Generic PCL drivers as a work-around would not have worked well for me in that specific case.</p>

<p>My company has a tiny number of Macs. Given our embrace of the Office365 stack, I can&rsquo;t imagine there will be too many difficulties. I did not run the Big Sur beta on work equipment because in the past that prevented me from accessing my Parallels VM. Last night I was able to update my work MacBook Pro and 24-hours later I have no regrets</p>

<p>In a world whose absurdity appears to be so impenetrable, we simply must reach a greater degree of understanding among men, a greater sincerity. We must achieve this or perish. To do so, certain conditions must be fulfilled: men must be frank (falsehood confuses things), free (communication is impossible with slaves).

<p>The sound was in a sweet spot for me. I heard sounds that reminded me of Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine, Swervedriver, Love and Rockets, Kitchens of Distinction, Bailter Space, and others. When I read of all the bands they have toured with, I was disappointed I hadn‚Äôt listened to them sooner. God bless streaming music!</p>

<p>I will likely be collecting their sounds.</p>

<p>I love the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Halloween_Tree"><em>The Halloween Tree</em></a> by Ray Bradbury.</p>

<p>It was one of the early young adult novels I read in my life, and possibly my first exposure to Ray Bradbury as a youth. As a boy it was the first time I had deeply considered death.</p>

<p>What I appreciated most was the historical scope and sweep of history, but I won&rsquo;t lie that I don&rsquo;t appreciate being so deeply mislead about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain">Samhain</a>. It&rsquo;s fiction, of course. An author can write what he wishes. Powerful imagery, but‚Ä¶ wrong.</p>

<p>Yet I own paper and electronic versions.</p>

<p>It means that much to me.</p>

<p>My love affair with Danse Macabre began in elementary school. Mrs. Otten played Halloween songs on the piano and we sang from mimeographed lyric sheets.</p>

<p>I was introduced to parts of the melody via a song called the <em>Halloween Song</em>, which has stuck in my head ever since, because the refrain includes singing the letters that spell the holiday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjkh8ninN2Y">It sounded a lot like this YouTube.</a> I&rsquo;m certain my teacher played a copy of this very recording.</p>

<p>In music classes in later years we listened to the symphonic version while watching filmstrips of artistic conceptions of what the various parts of the music could represent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/music/read/danse-macabre-a-brief-history-of-halloween-s-haunting-anthem-1.5062586">Here&rsquo;s a great article from CBC</a> which includes some great background on the piece and some really enjoyable renditions including one for two pianos.</p>

<p>For me the piece is tied to Autumn and to All Hallow&rsquo;s Evening, even though it wasn&rsquo;t the intent of the composer.</p>

<p>Schools don&rsquo;t track holidays the same way as they did, a long time ago. So for my daughter, I have work to do If I want this to stick.</p>

<p>I am deeply disappointed by quality control as our orders leave the house, however. Errors are so frequent that I‚Äôm actually happy when one order arrives complete. This is not a criticism of one restaurant or delivery service. It is a criticism of them all.</p>

<p>Quality has not improved since I worked the Burger King drive-through in the 1980‚Äôs.</p>

<p>I know the pressure is intense. I have worked at fast food and pizza joints. I get it.</p>

         	<p>Spent some time this morning watching shows about politics and shows about the consequences of political conflict.</p>

<p>Any time we think of groups of people that include friends, neighbors and family as an enemy, I wonder if we aren&rsquo;t then the problem. I&rsquo;m including myself, here.</p>

<p>I do hereby disavow political parties. I will continue to study and learn. I will be performing my civic duty this fall to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>The whole wide world<br />
An endless universe<br />
Yet we keep looking through<br />
The eyeglass in reverse<br />
Don&rsquo;t feed the people<br />
But we feed the machines<br />
Can&rsquo;t really feel<br />
What international means<br />
In different circles<br />
We keep holding our ground<br />
Indifferent circles<br />
We keep spinning round and round</p>

         	<p>And‚Ä¶the worst case? I asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFacebook might have won already, which would mean the end of democracy in this century,‚Äù <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jaron-lanier-tech-oracle-profile">Lanier said.</a> ‚ÄúIt&rsquo;s possible that we can&rsquo;t quite get out of this system of paranoia and tribalism for profit‚Äîit&rsquo;s just too powerful and it&rsquo;ll tear everything apart, leaving us with a world of oligarchs and autocrats who aren&rsquo;t able to deal with real problems like pandemics and climate change and whatnot and that we fall apart, you know, we lose it. That is a real possibility for this century. I&rsquo;m not saying I think it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll happen, but I wouldn&rsquo;t count it out. There&rsquo;s evidence every single day that it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.‚Äù</p>

<p>Take the amount of misinformation about masks and COVID-19 that was flying around Facebook and Twitter daily and in turn making its way onto Fox News. Most of the people who appear on air on Fox, Lanier pointed out, are themselves on social media, getting their information or lack thereof. And so disinformation goes from Twitter to Fox to the social media feeds of the president, and the cycle begins anew. Look at how powerful these platforms could be, to the point where ‚Äúthe sway of media is more powerful than the experience of reality‚Äîthat people can be watching hundreds of thousands die from this virus and yet believe it&rsquo;s a hoax at the same time, and integrate those two things. That&rsquo;s the food for evil,‚Äù Lanier said.</p>

Not my iPad, for which there is no native Instagram app, and for which the work-alikes did not allow multiple selections. So, while my iPhone was charging, I downloaded the iPhone app to my iPad, did the pixel doubling so I could type, and did the work that way.</p>

<p>There are probably more ways to do this, and really I wanted to do it elegantly from my MacBook Air, however I didn&rsquo;t perceive a faster method than exporting and uploading, and I chose not to do that.</p>

         	<p>Please allow me to quote heavily from The Bard <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/tao-lin/2013/06/13-quotes-from-terence-mckenna/">Terence McKenna</a>‚Äîthis selection comes from a discussion about language:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We use rapidly modulated small mouth noises. As primates we have incredible ability to make small mouth noises. We can do this for up to six hours at a stretch without tiring. No other thing we can do approaches the level of variation with low energy investment that the small mouth noises do. A person using a deaf-and-dumb language is exhausted after forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>But a problem with the small mouth noises mode of communication is: I have a thought, I look in a dictionary that I have created out of my life experience, I map the thought onto the dictionary, I make the requisite small mouth noises, they cross physical space, they enter your ear, you look in your dictionary, which is different from my dictionary, but if we speak what we call ‚Äòthe same language‚Äô it will be close enough that you will ‚Äòsort of‚Äô understand what I mean. Now if I don‚Äôt say to you, ‚Äòwhat do I mean?‚Äô you and I will go gaily off in the assumption that we understand each other.</p>

         	<p>Thinking about old forms of media, I am torn about attempting to digitize old formats versus (re)buying. Something like an old movie on a DVD is low hanging fruit, as is music on CDs. I&rsquo;ve long had CDs ripped and am working on movies.</p>

<p>But cassettes and vinyl‚Äîthere is a labor of love. Transcribing happens in real time, then editing is necessary to separate tracks dubbed during the session&hellip;</p>

<p>There is great equipment available to do a good job of this, even for a home hobbyist.</p>

<p>The issue is time.</p>

<p>And releasing music I can find no other way.</p>

         	<p>Aiwa AD-F350U</p>

<p>Used a tape deck very much like the one pictured here. It was the first audio equipment I purchased. It played through a little amplifier I purchased in kit form and assembled in a high-school electronics class.</p>

<p>I dubbed many, many records from friends. Listened to hundreds of albums purchased new on cassette. Thousands of hours of my life are connected to this. Such an 80s artifact. It survived into the early 2000s but one too many lightning strikes to the power grid took it out. Still have the library of aging cassettes.</p>

<p>For two decades, this was a critical furnishing in any of my living spaces.</p>

<p>Listening to older music makes me think of the past.</p>

<p>The internet did not disappoint me. I was able to triangulate and find an image of the very model I used to own.</p>

         	<p>Executive Order May 29, 2020, 2020-11</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/emergency-management/coronavirus-covid-19/emergency-executive-orders#May%2029,%202020-11">EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER 2020-11</a></p>

<p>I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, on May 29, 2020, pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code Section 13.06, do hereby issue the following Executive Order:</p>

<p>On May 29, 2020, pursuant to Minn. Stat. ¬ß 12.29, I issued an Emergency Declaration, declaring a Peacetime Emergency due to the civil unrest occurring throughout Saint Paul.</p>

<p>Saint Paul Leg. Code Chapter 13.06(b) provides that, ‚Äúwhenever necessary to meet an emergency ‚Ä¶ the mayor may by executive order promulgate regulations ‚Ä¶ for which adequate regulations have not been adopted ‚Ä¶ respecting ‚Ä¶the conduct of persons and the use of property during emergencies; the repair, maintenance and safeguarding of essential public services; emergency health, fire and safety regulations; and all other matters which are required to protect public safety, health and welfare in emergencies‚Äù.</p>

<p>On May 25, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed and in the custody of officers of the Minneapolis Police Department. Other Minneapolis police officers stood guard as witnesses begged the officers to provide life-saving aid to George Floyd. Civil unrest has arisen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since Mr. Floyd‚Äôs death. This civil unrest included mass protests in Minneapolis on May 26-28, 2020 which caused injuries, looting and the destruction of public and private property. This civil unrest, including looting and the destruction of property, has spread to Saint Paul as of May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020 the Saint Paul Fire Chief reported that between May 28, 2020 and May 29, 2020, the City received over 300 calls for service for fires, 126 of which were related to fire calls and 55 of which were confirmed. A curfew is necessary in order to ensure the public safety of the people of Saint Paul.</p>

<p>Governor Walz, in Executive Order 20-56, has declared a peacetime emergency in the City of Saint Paul as well as the City of Minneapolis and the ‚Äúsurrounding communities‚Äù. Governor Walz, as part of Executive Order 20-56, has also activated the National Guard to support in emergency operations and response. On May 29, 2020. Governor Walz issued Executive Order 20-65 implementing a night-time curfew in the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, Melvin Carter III, Mayor of the City of Saint Paul, do hereby issue the following Emergency Executive Order:</p>

<p>Night-time Curfew: effective May, 29, 2020, at 8:00 P.M. a curfew is imposed in all public places within the City of Saint Paul between the hours of 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.
Travel Prohibited. During the curfew, all persons must not travel on any public street or public place.
Exemptions. All law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, and members of the news media, as well as other personnel authorized by the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minnesota State Patrol, or Minnesota National Guard, are exempt from the curfew. Individuals traveling directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing danger, or experiencing homelessness are also exempt.</p>

<p>Definitions.
a. For the purposes of this Executive Order, ‚Äútravel‚Äù includes, without limitation, travel on foot, bicycle, skateboard, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, or any other mode of transporting a person from one location to another.
b. For the purposes of this Executive Order, a ‚Äúpublic place‚Äù is any place, whether on privately or publicly owned property, accessible to the general public, including but not limited to public streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks, vacant lots, and unsupervised property.
Enforcement.
a. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 12.45, an individual who willfully violates this Executive Order is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days.
b. Any person who disobeys a lawful order of a regular member or auxiliary member of the police or fire departments enforcing this Executive Order or another person having a specific emergency management assignment and displaying their official identification enforcing this Executive Order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor pursuant to Saint Paul Legislative Code 13.13.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Chapter 13 of the Saint Paul Legislative Code, this Executive Order is in immediate effect upon my signature and, if not sooner rescinded or later extended, shall expire at 6:00 A.M. on May 31, 2020.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-neighborhood-leaders-issue-tips-to-protect-residents-as-another-riot-looms">Here is the full list</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Be off the streets at 8:00 p.m.<br /></li>
<li>Be aware of suspicious activities/groups<br /></li>
<li>Be aware of large gatherings<br /></li>
<li>Call 911 if you are witnessing suspicious activity<br /></li>
<li>Remove anything from your lawn that could be flammable or a projectile through a window<br /></li>
<li>Store dumpsters in your garage or move to hidden area in back yard. Consider wetting down the inside contents if they have to be left outside in view.<br /></li>
<li>Keep LIGHTS ON and some windows open to hear noises that may be approaching. (use caution with windows that may be easily asked from the ground)<br /></li>
<li>Have an escape plan and a to-go bag (remember to take along any medicines you may need)<br /></li>
<li>If you need to be outside wear headlamp, bright colors and reflective clothing<br /></li>
<li>Charge cell phones. Cell towers might go out<br /></li>
<li>Have alternative ways to communicate with your neighbors and help them to make a plan in case things do get bad.<br /></li>
<li>Have garden hoses ready and untangled for possible use.<br /></li>
<li>Check your flood lights; door lights; KEEP THEM ON.<br /></li>
<li>Soak down wood fences and surfaces</li>
<li>If you have a Little Free Library-empty it.<br /></li>
<li>If you have a fire extinguisher-get it ready<br /></li>
<li>Check on each other-especially older neighbors, and the vulnerable.<br /></li>
<li>For those who choose to stand outside, watching homes or businesses, do not confront anyone. Call 911, call another neighbor to be with you.</li>
</ul>

He quotes physician Dr. James Hamblin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe thing is if shutdowns and social distancing work perfectly and are extremely effective it will seem in retrospect like they were totally unnecessary overreactions.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and epidemiologist Mari Armstrong-Hough:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt ever know if what you did personally helped. That‚Äôs the nature of public health. When the best way to save lives is to prevent a disease rather than treat it, success often looks like an overreaction.‚Äù</p>

        <a href="https://1-1.hjalmer.com/2019/12/28/how-i-made.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-28 18:30:00 -0500">Dec 28, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have transitioned to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> as my primary online presence, but I still have my Twitter account. While I have often entertained leaving it altogether, I still wish to keep my handle. I have also found that with thoughtful curation, it&rsquo;s still a place to learn new things about the world and to be excited by new people and topics.</p>

<p>One big change came after applying a suggestion from <a href="https://micro.blog/patrickrhone">@patrickrhone</a>. He announced that he had turned off retweets for accounts he follows. This ingenious trick goes a long way to reduce tweets from people that you do not follow and will reduce tweets on topics you care nothing about. The tweets you see are true to the voice of the person behind the account and not the voices of others they may follow. You will still see shared tweets, but the commentary adds context. It takes more time to share tweets this way, so the tweets shared in this fashion are more meaningful. It does require accepting that you will see fewer tweets overall, so some opportunity to learn about like-minded individuals is lost.</p>

<p>Retweets are also a measure for accounts you may be interested in following. How many tweets in their streams are written by themselves? How much of their streams are just the tweets of others? It also has made me think about  the act of retweeting for myself. I will like a tweet that speaks to me, but I rarely retweet any more.</p>

<p>A second big change was to filter out political language. Both primary political parties in the United States have lost my respect completely. Politics make me angry and sad, and that is not the experience I want from my Twitter stream. I run from political discussion as much as others specifically seek it out. I have blocked words that refer to the political parties, words that refer to the political spectrum, words that refer to the people in the parties, and words used to denigrate members of parties other than one&rsquo;s own. I have had enough. I do follow the accounts of folks elected to represent me, but the same filters apply so I probably don&rsquo;t see much from those same people.</p>

<p>And lastly, there is that curation thing. I don&rsquo;t love that word as applied by marketing teams, but I have made a point to think about my own ideals and what is important to me and I measure who I follow against that. When accounts make me angry or sad, I simply unfollow. When I can no longer tell why I followed a specific account, I unfollow. When I see accounts that appear to be trolling or are otherwise propagating falsehoods because they can, I block. Easy.</p>

<p>Curating also can be applied from areas of interest or study or self-improvement. Writers whose work appears in places that excite me are easy follows. Artists whose work I admire are easy follows. Companies doing work I&rsquo;m interested in are easy follows. Individuals committed to causes dear to me are easy follows. But all of the filters above apply.</p>

<p>Even though I have put strict filters in place, the mouth of the funnel is still pretty wide and lots of great material makes it through. I still cannot keep up with the firehose.</p>

         	<p>A lesson I have not learned is that I affect the people I live with my moods and actions. Not intending to cause harm is not the same as not causing harm. And not saying every stupid thing doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt say small things stupidly.</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt learned how to intercept my feelings more quickly. I haven‚Äôt learned how let the emotions flow without being swept up in them.</p>

<p>Sometimes things are spinning sideways pretty spectacularly before I understand that I am the spinner.</p>

<p>It is humbling to recognize the work in front of me to be better.</p>

<p>I hope that my actions will soon show that I have internalized this lesson because I no longer repeat it.</p>

         	<p>Writing is terrifying, isn‚Äôt it?</p>

<p>I mean, when you over-think it, as I am inclined to do.</p>

<p>I have a good vocabulary. I know I can do a good job constructing sentences and paragraphs. I have many great places to record my thoughts.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs my internal editor whose objections are the hardest to overcome.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEverybody has already said that.‚Äù<br />
‚ÄúEverybody is going to hate it if you say that.‚Äù<br />
‚ÄúWhat if that‚Äôs an idea that will become terribly unpopular in three years? Am I going to be allowed to evolve?‚Äù<br />
‚ÄúIs this going to affect my job if my co-workers see this?‚Äù</p>

<p>So please forgive the milquetoast as I get over myself. I know these thoughts do not make me unique in any way.</p>

<p>I have deep admiration for those who write and create regularly, revealing themselves and showing vulnerability.</p>

<p>I am grateful to you for lighting the way.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I watched two movies about the Apollo Space Program this weekend.</p>

<p>The experience is very complex for me, emotionally. The experience of writing this post is an attempt to define what it means.</p>

<p>I had read recently about a film that was making its way through festivals and Friday I tried to figure out what it was called. But I might be wrong about its provenance. And while I couldn‚Äôt remember a title or find what I thought I was looking for, I did find some documentaries available online which seemed to cover similar ground.</p>

<p>The first documentary is called <em>For All Mankind</em>. It was released in 1989, several years after the <em>Challenger</em> disaster.</p>

<p>It was about all of the lunar missions, though the footage and narration was respective to the individual missions.</p>

<p>I found myself full of the same wonder today as I have always had.</p>

<p>In my lifetime, there has always been a space program. For a while, while I was younger, I believed there would be an opportunity for me to at least get to orbit. After all, at Christmastime in my first year of life, we orbited the moon. And not long after that, mission after mission got us to the surface of the moon itself.</p>

<p>When the Shuttle program was announced, I felt it was a natural progression. <em>Of course</em> we were going to have space planes. Of course we were going to find ways to make space travel easier and less expensive.</p>

<p>I remember well in my senior year of high school when <em>Challenger</em> failed. I felt disbelief and horror. My Chemistry teacher had submitted ideas for experiments to be carried aloft on that flight. One of my classmates figured out early on that an easy way to derail his lectures was to ask about the space program and his chances. I loved it. My chemistry teacher did, too.</p>

<p>I checked out books from the school library full of illustrations and speculations about what space craft might look like. What would space stations be used for? Would we build colonies in space? Could we survive on other planets?</p>

<p>It seemed, once, like there might have been an imperative. So many books and TV series and movies that I consumed pointed up to the sky and out of the solar system. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Six-Million Dollar Man, Star Trek, Space 1999, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, Star Wars, Cosmos, Alien, Cosmos, even Blade Runner, all showed me this was not only possible but normal.</p>

<p>And so, the footage re-assembled in <em>For All Mankind</em> returned the feeling of wonder and the sense of the imperative to me. And I have missed that. As much as the movie is about the missions, it also is a fun window into a brief time and place.</p>

<p>The second film I found is <em>In the Shadow of the Moon</em>. This is a much different film. While it is about the same events in the Apollo missions, the context and the subject is the recollection of the experience by many of the surviving astronauts. How they felt about their roles and what they remembered about their thoughts as events transpired.</p>

<p>I learned that the astronauts themselves were involved in the design of the craft they flew. I learned that astronauts were on the ground working as part of mission control as the missions were in progress.</p>

<p>And I learned the astronauts were taken by the perception of people around the world that we all were a part of the missions, that the success of the missions belongs to all of humanity. They have been greeted for the rest of their lives not with ‚ÄúYou did it!‚Äù but rather with ‚ÄúWe did it!‚Äù</p>

<p>I was profoundly struck by the final few minutes when clearly the astronauts were asked how they were affected, and how their perspective has changed. I found it deeply moving and I don‚Äôt want to spoil it for anyone considering watching it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd definitely re-watch either film. For me it was very bittersweet. I hope someday we can stop poking at each other for sport. I hope someday we can take stock of the amazing gifts we have and consider the what we can leave behind for those generations we will never know.</p>

<p>POSTSCRIPT</p>

<p>The movie I had read about is called <em>Apollo 11</em>. It&rsquo;s going to be released first in IMAX, then in traditional theatres shortly thereafter.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôm casting my lot with <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> at the moment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been lost for a long time after I moved away from Palm Pilots. I never really got traction in Outlook or PlanPlus on the software side. I have flirted with Things, OmniFocus, Microsoft ToDo, Wonderlist, Informant, ToodleDo, Evernote, Tasks and Notes.</p>

<p>On the paper side I&rsquo;ve tried Franklin-Covey methodology, I&rsquo;ve carried Midori travel notebooks and I have tried Bullet Journaling.</p>

<p>I love paper. I love pencils. I love fountain pens. I found a roller ball pen that I like using that won&rsquo;t explode or break in my pockets.</p>

<p>I found out I like grid-lined notebooks but I love dot-grid even more. I found out I don‚Äôt love the shape of Midori paper, I prefer A4 and A5 sized notepads and notebooks. <em>Leuchtterm</em> and <em>Scribbles that Matter</em> make notebooks that are wonderful companions. Skip the decorative layouts from YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram. Stick to <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn">The System</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm good at capture on paper but really bad at follow-through and prioritizing. And especially bad at keeping important things from previous days in front of me. This is my biggest opportunity.</p>

<p>So, wow, tools have really become much better. I understand what I want to accomplish better. And and ideas from Bullet Journaling really translate to software in ways I wouldn&rsquo;t have understood without taking my second Oddyssey through journaling on paper. This makes me happy.</p>

<p>I still have to do the work, but I&rsquo;m excited.</p>

<p>The next quest is for software I can keep in my phone to help with habit-tracking, tracking meals, tracking moods and other health characteristics. I have a lot of changes to make.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m open to suggestions on places to look and methods to explore.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about supporting technology. In my career, my tendency to experiment and to follow my curiousity has been rewarded. Experimenting has enabled me to understand where there are real limits and risks, and has helped me to understand steps I can take to protect myself and steps I can take to recover. Going through these kinds of exercises repeatedly has removed fear and uncertainty and increased confidence.</p>

<p>Even though we all click on things and type, experimentation with technology is not a part of most professions. Some only deal with technology in a strict, procedure-driven sense. Failure to follow procedure leads to negative consequences.</p>

<p>Until recently, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that one reason that people will not reach out for assistance with technology is  the fear of being perceived either as ignorant or incompetent to perform their jobs. These are people who otherwise have great amounts of experience, expertise, and wisdom in their vocation, but who feel thwarted by tools that seem impenetrable or incomprehensible, yet are presented as critical.</p>

<p>As technologists, we are just not trained to understand there are very human and emotional reasons that technology might not work. Emotions and culture affect all of our interactions, from simple break-fix support  to the largest enterprise projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested in changing what I do, and how I do it, to increase the benefit. I&rsquo;m interested in starting with that awareness, instead of compensating with re-work later, or wondering why a project failed if the technology was seemingly rational or the right thing to implement.</p>

         	<p>I have carried multiple communication devices several times in my career, including for the past 5 years at my current employer. My rationalization initially was to separate support calls from my personal life. A second benefit was to use a second carrier on different spectrum to ensure strong signal.</p>

<p>Logistically, that&rsquo;s two devices on my person. Two Apple IDs. Two places for notifications to acknowledge. Two calendars. Two devices to update and to charge every day. More stuff to pack when I travel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not two people. I understand now that the extra effort is a distraction from more importal goals and work. I&rsquo;m not Work Hjalmer and Home Hjalmer. I&rsquo;m Hjalmer.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m simplifying to a single device: Transitioning this weekend, then cutting service for the second number this week.</p>

<p>For folks in my personal life, I&rsquo;m keeping the number I&rsquo;ve had since about 2002. For my work colleagues, stay tuned for updates through official channels.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m not lucky, I still win. I learn a new method, or a new perspective, or new patience. My knowledge in some respect will deepen. I have the relative luxury of rebuilding my model of the problem and restarting steps to resolution.</p>

<p>I have finally understood that this same approach in personal relationships is so wrong and so ineffective. It&rsquo;s best to start with no assumptions. No reactions. And no talking until I get it.</p>

<p>And I suppose here, too, I&rsquo;ve had the luxury of people tolerant of my quirks.</p>

Video:<a href="https://youtu.be/LLCF7vPanrY">A Time-Lapse Map of Every Nuclear Explosion Since 1945 - by Isao Hashimoto</a></p>

<p>I would never have guessed anywhere near this number of detonations, ever.</p>

<p>What is the longterm legacy in our environment?</p>

<p>A big question I have is whether there is a correlation between the number of these devices set off and the heat in our atmosphere. If a single volcano can change global temperatures for years, what is the net effect of the waste heat and radiation generated by more than two thousand of these?</p>

<p>I love the counterpoint between the refrain saying &ldquo;Half of the time we&rsquo;re gone, but we don&rsquo;t know where&hellip;&rdquo; and the backup singers singing &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The album <em>Bridge Over Troubled Water</em>, featuring the title track, came out in 1970, before I was two. I started listening to it in earnest when I was a teenager about ten years later. It&rsquo;s still one of my favorite albums.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed <em>The Only Living Boy in New York</em>, it stands out to me even as much as the more famous tracks.</p>

<p>I listened to the Purple Rain soundtrack, watched the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NN3gsSf-Ys">Prince&rsquo;s Superbowl halftime performance</a>, then spent at least an hour listening to the song Purple Rain on repeat.</p>

         	<p>I listened to parts of two different albums tonight.</p>

<p>When I first listened to each album, my life couldn&rsquo;t have been more different, emotionally. The albums were released only a few years apart, but one came during a happier time and another came during a dark descent.</p>

<p>Listening to each one, tonight, brought back places, names and faces.</p>

<p>Funny, the places one can travel, just by picking an album out of a list.</p>

         	<p>There is no end to discovery in music.</p>

<p>I have been listening to _Pink Moon_¬†by Nick Drake on repeat for about the last two hours. Just the one song, which is something I rarely do.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/"><em>The Lake House</em></a>¬†on TV last night, and it was featured in the soundtrack. And I remembered that it was in Volkswagen convertible commercials a long time ago. Maybe ten years ago? I had assumed at that time that it was a current song by a current commercial artist. You know, because Volkswagen and Mitsubishi had been using Crystal Method, Dirty Vegas and Propellerheads tracks. I won‚Äôt lie: I have purchased albums on the basis of television commercials.</p>

<p>But hearing it again made it fresh and I was determined this time to find it and download it.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not on the soundtrack album for <em>The Lake House</em>. Fortunately, IMDB lists the songs in the movie, in what I&rsquo;m guessing is order of appearance.</p>

<p>I made a lot of wrong guesses as to which song it might be, because I didn‚Äôt think through the lyrics as they related to the song title.¬†And I assumed incorrectly the song was from the late 90s.</p>

<p>SO. If he was still alive, I would owe Nick Drake an apology. And I find myself wondering what the rest of his ≈ìuvre is like. _Pink Moon_¬†is the title track of his third album, released in 1972. He didn&rsquo;t live long enough to produce a fourth.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a sweet, stripped down, two-minute song. Two guitars and a few notes on a piano, and <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/nick+drake/pink+moon_20100351.html" target="_blank">a few lines of poetry</a> repeated twice:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>Kim and Jessie</em> is a song that I can easily put on repeat.</p>

<p>M83‚Äôs last two albums have been trending toward a sound that is very nostalgic for me, and this particular song is a stand out example.</p>

<p>Though the song was released in 2008, it is heavily evocative of mid-1980s groups like ‚ÄôTil Tuesday, Flock of Seagulls, and Tears for Fears. If you played a string of Top 40 hits from 1985 or 1986, and slipped in <em>Kim and Jessie</em>,¬†I¬†think a lot of people would think it sounds similar and familiar. Whether that makes you die inside a little or makes you a little giddy is personal, of course.</p>

<p>The lyric is simple, and most of the song is repetition of the chorus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somebody lurks in the shadows<br />
Somebody whispers<br />
Somebody lurks in the shadows<br />
Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the repetition of the lyric in the last part of the song really works for me, because it gives me a chance to notice the additional vocal parts and the simultaneous guitar solo which are layered subtly, not detracting from the melody but awaiting your attention.</p>

<p>I had not seen the video until just before writing this piece. While it doesn‚Äôt sync to the lyric, I think it tells a similar story that is equally open to interpretation.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Tonight,¬†I signed up for Amazon&rsquo;s free cloud player service‚Äîspecifically because of news items I read about Amazon&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_367461502_1?ie=UTF8&node=5946775011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=hero-quick-promo&pf_rd_r=0GZT444XYC9GP39PEG6M&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=1465597482&pf_rd_i=B003A7I4XA">AutoRip</a> service.</p>

<p>AutoRIP is something that ought to have been done a long time ago. If you buy a qualifying CD, subject to the terms of licensing between Amazon and the major record labels, you get the <span class="GRcorrect">dics</span> shipped to your house and you get an electronic copy placed in your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/mp3/player">Amazon Cloud Player</a>¬†library. These electronic copies are <span class="GRcorrect">back-dated</span> as well. Amazon says any qualifying CD purchase since 1998 also (eventually) will be put into your Cloud Player.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I had to sign up for the free account. As an aside, I learned that you can store 250,000 tracks in your cloud player for $25 per year. This is ten times the music that iTunes Match allows for the same price. I find myself tempted to store music here, too. (<em>This has changed. iTunes Match allows 100,000 tracks</em>)</p>

<p>Of the few CDs that Amazon initially has put into my Cloud Player library is a CD I purchased in November of 2004 by an artist whose name I am not familiar with. In fact I do not even know where I would have heard about the album at all. What&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t see the CD on my shelving which is a concern because I try to strictly alphabetize by artist and album.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt mean I never had it. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the album isn&rsquo;t associated with my Cloud Player account by mistake, either.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I have binged and purged music, bought, sold, gifted and traded. But this one just doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Road">Lhasa - The Living Road</a></p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Most of the discs I&rsquo;ve bought have been via Amazon&rsquo;s web site, but actually were purchased from a lot of private sellers. So those will never show up via AutoRip and therefore I am sad.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have a large iTunes library. It doesn&rsquo;t represent everything I have ever heard, nor everything I have ever loved, nor even everything I own. But that iTunes library is becoming a beast to manage.<br /><br />There is SO much data about the music‚Äîthat isn&rsquo;t the music‚Äîbut is integral.</p>

<p>Recently I have made it a personal project to make sure a single piece of information exists for each track: the release date, the day it became available for sale to the public.</p>

<p>I began this project because I was completely dismayed at the amount of music I have imported into my library without a date at all, and also frustrated by the number of albums imported with a re-release date instead of the original release date. The re-release date to me is like restoring a 1966 Ford Mustang and then saying it is a current-year Ford Mustang. No. Therefore, even when an album is remastered a second or third time, it is still a product of its era.</p>

<p>The release date is important to me. I remember where and when a piece of music was first a part of my life. I remember the order albums were released by favorite artists. So, when I sort my library by date, I want it to match that experience. For example, when I was a Freshman in high school, there was a radio show from midnight to 2 AM on Monday mornings where I first heard <em>Mad World</em> by Tears for Fears. This is opposed to the first time I heard <em>Shout</em>, also by Tears for Fears. I was a Junior in high school by then. I walked into Musicland in the Ridgedale mall in Minnetonka, Minnesota. It was playing in store and I bought the cassette on the spot. So my iTunes library had better get it right.</p>

<p>Aside: In the movie High Fidelity, the protagonist spends significant time sorting his collection of albums chronologically by relationship. <em>This makes enormous sense to me</em>.</p>

<p>Back to data: that raw list of data‚Äîdisembodied though it is from the music‚Äîis becoming something I refer to much as I used to refer to liner notes, those tiny cassette j-cards, or the somewhat larger CD booklets. I don&rsquo;t always remember the details, so I want iTunes to be true.</p>

<p>Another case where I find date information jarring is with ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù or other career-spanning collections of songs. The date associated with a song in this case is often the release date of the collection. Yet, that date might be decades removed from when a song in the collection was originally released. This is important to me because I have playlists built by decade. When I am hearing <em>Can&rsquo;t Get You Out Of My Head</em>, which Kylie Minogue released in 2002 (in the US), I don&rsquo;t necessarily want the next track I hear to be _Mother&rsquo;s Little Helper_¬†just because the Rolling Stones&rsquo; ‚ÄúForty Licks‚Äù compilation was also released in 2002.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, it took the ‚ÄúForty Licks‚Äù compilation to make me realize I am a bigger &lsquo;Stones fan than I thought, particularly with material released before 1970. I also now have a more profound respect for their career longevity. They are still making music.</p>

<p>So, in my iTunes library, the songs from ‚ÄúForty Licks‚Äù all reflect the year they were released as singles, with the exception of the four tracks that appear nowhere else‚Äîthose tracks stay in 2002, though I did for a long time consider dating them from the sessions in which they were recorded. <em>I have reconsidered this position repeatedly</em>.</p>

<p>There are still about 3,000 items in my library that are un-dated.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on missing or incorrect album art.</p>

<p>I will be researching music for a long time to come.</p>

         	<p>I don&rsquo;t claim any special privilege, knowledge, education or access. Like many friends, and friends I haven&rsquo;t met, I simply love music.</p>

<p>I got my first portable FM radio somewhere around the Christmas of 1978, and I have been trying to carry music everywhere with me ever since. It means that much to me.</p>

<p>In 1990 I went to work at a record store. You see, I thought I knew about music. I had been actively listening to radio and watching MTV and going to other record stores. I must have had a few hundred cassettes and dozens of LPs and dozens of CDs by then.</p>

<p>I found out that I didn&rsquo;t know much. The next four years blew my head open, again and again. The reality was, despite what I knew, the information flowed in reverse: I was learning from customers and coworkers.¬†I was forced to confront my many biases because they got in the way.</p>

<p>I learned that the amount of beautiful music never played on radio, never on TV shows, never in movies, never in clubs, is astonishing. In fact, it is overwhelming.</p>

<p>It is impossible to keep up, to keep current, to be aware of all scenes, or to keep just one scene alive.</p>

<p>Music is a vast and deep ocean.¬†Changing a perspective just slightly cracks open new ways to appreciate what you hear, to develop a feel for where it came from and for why it must be.¬†Look at¬†genealogies¬†and chronologies of influences and genres. Consider political movements, cultural identity and social issues. Look at how technology has affected everything: production, performance, distribution, storage, spectacle, and ultimately what it means to be an artist.</p>

<p>What is harder to explain, and what makes music so deeply personal, is that <em>something</em> in a musical passage that sends chills up your spine, the lyric that always makes your voice break, or that sound that insists that you must move.</p>

<p>I hope to write about all of those things. But I warn you I probably won&rsquo;t do it in any sort of ordered or organized fashion. I hope to impart a sense of wonder. And I hope that I keep learning.</p>

<p>Note: Because Billy Joel once lamented ‚Äú‚Ä¶You can&rsquo;t get the sound because it&rsquo;s only in a magazine‚Ä¶‚Äù (<em>It&rsquo;s Still Rock and Roll to Me</em> from <em>Glass Houses</em>), I hope to provide links to lyrics and videos where they exist and when appropriate.</p>
